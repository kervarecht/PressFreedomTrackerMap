In his last <a href=""https://twitter.com/newsguz/status/1267638156368719874"">video</a>, Martínez Contreras captured his own arrest while livestreaming.</p><p>The video, posted around 10 p.m., shows a suddenly tense scene compared to his previous footage. Asbury Park police began to enforce the curfew by advancing in riot gear and making arrests. A police officer shoved Martínez Contreras, apologized with no explanation, and returned attention to protesters.</p><p>Minutes later on the feed, Martínez Contreras filmed police arresting two young protesters when two police officers approached him shouting “Go home” and “This shit is fucking over.” A third police officer off-screen said “Fuck him, he’s the problem” and tackled Martínez Contreras to the ground. “You&#x27;re under arrest.

Police escorted him to a van transporting arrested protesters.</p><p>On the way to the van, an officer asked Martínez Contreras what was hanging around his neck, Martínez Contreras wrote. His press badge, he replied. It was one of several times Martínez Contreras identified himself as a journalist to the police before, during, and after his arrest.</p><p>The van took the prisoners to Belmar Police Department. Martínez Contreras told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that a plainclothes officer asked him if he knew about or had any interaction at the protest with the radical left-wing activist movement Antifa, a group President Donald Trump vowed to declare a terrorist organization, even though he reportedly may lack the legal authority to do so. Martínez Contreras said he was familiar with the group because of his work as a journalist. He said the officer warned him to avoid Antifa because it is a terrorist organization.</p><p>Martínez Contreras was released the following morning after five hours in custody, he wrote.

Ray, who had two cameras around his neck, was not wearing a press pass at the time, but doubted that would have helped under the circumstances. The blow “came out of nowhere. It wasn’t a situation where I was being asked to show credentials or anything.”</p><p>The pain from the injury grew throughout the day but had dissipated by the next morning, he said.</p><p>Around 6:46 p.m., Cerise Castle, a reporter for KCRW, a Santa Monica NPR affiliate, was reporting at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue when she reported being hit by a rubber bullet. She was holding her press badge above her head at the time, she <a href=""https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1266878695555231747?s=19"">tweeted</a>.</p><p>In a statement emailed to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Castle said the incident occurred when she was photographing a group of LAPD officers in riot gear who had just arrived in the back of an open truck.</p><p>“As I was snapping photos, the police descended from their vehicle and began pointing rifles at the crowd. People started to run, I held my ground and continued to take pictures. This is when the shooting started, without warning or prior order to disperse,” she wrote. “I screamed after the first gunshot, then pulled myself together and began yelling PRESS and removed my lanyard from my neck, and held it above my head.”</p><p>The rubber bullet that hit her arm above the elbow crease was fired by an officer with whom she had just locked eyes with, she added. As she ran away, she sprained her ankle and is currently on crutches.</p><p>Jintak Han, a photographer and reporter for the Daily Bruin, UCLA’s student newspaper, was wrapping up an afternoon reporting on the protests and trying to cross Beverly Boulevard to head back to his car around 7:15 p.m. when he found himself facing a police line that was clearing protestors block-by-block, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists via Twitter message.</p><p>Han was readily identifiable as a journalist, wearing a press pass, as well as a white helmet and a vest emblazoned with “PRESS,” and carrying three cameras.</p><p>Despite this, he said, an officer aimed his weapon at him, prompting Han to raise both hands in the air. He moved into an opening, and soon was standing “some distance away” from a group of four protestors who were shielding themselves behind a mattress when officers opened fire. “The rubber bullets fell short and hit the ground near my feet before I hid behind the mattress,” he told CPJ.</p></div></div>

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>While Radzius was reporting alone, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists in a phone interview that he was near a group of reporters during the protests. The protest, one of many that took place across New York City on May 30, began at around 3 p.m. near Prospect Park and continued south to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. Radzius characterized the protest as “largely peaceful” in a statement about the incident that he wrote for the police that he provided to CPJ. Radzius said in his interview and in the statement that he had a 1010 WINS microphone and people told him they liked the station and thanked him for reporting on the protest.</p><p>Radzius was carrying press credentials, but they were not displayed, he told CPJ. His 1010 WINS microphone flag was large and identified him clearly as media, he said.</p><p>According to Radzius’ statement to the police, a few hours into the protest, he followed a group of people who left the central location of the protest, thinking them to be protesters. The group and Radzius walked to College Wine and Liquors, a liquor store in Flatbush. Radzius witnessed a group of people loot the store, and filmed the entire incident on his cellphone for 30 seconds, before the store owner locked the door. Radzius <a href=""https://twitter.com/DariusRadzius/status/1266937831383015424"">tweeted</a> a video clip of the looting.</p><p>Radzius called his editor at 1010 WINS to tell him about the looting and joined a live radio broadcast from the scene at 6:32 p.m. A few seconds after signing off, Radzius was approached by a woman who asked him who he was talking to, according to his statement. Radzius responded that he was talking to “all New Yorkers on the radio.” A few seconds later, Radzius says he heard a male voice shout, “Snitch.” Radzius was then struck from behind on the right side of his upper face.</p><p>Radzius does not know who hit him. A witness told him that the attacker was a man, and that he struck Radzius with an unidentified object.</p><p>After being hit, Radzius says he was “stunned.” He received medical assistance at the scene from a woman who identified herself as a nurse. He later went to the hospital. He sustained injuries to his face that required five stitches above his eye on the eyebrow. Radzius also has significant bruising around his right eye, and has injuries to his hands. He later <a href=""https://twitter.com/DariusRadzius/status/1266939308650438657"">tweeted photos</a> of his injuries.</p><p>Radizus told CPJ that he thinks he was targeted for being a journalist. “What does a journalist do?

He was standing behind a light post looking at his cell phone when a flying object he suspects to have been a tear gas canister bounced off the light post before hitting him squarely in the face, on his right eye.

Gray told the Tracker that the officer said something to the effect of, “Alright, no no no, I’ll take him away.”</p><p>Officers then took Gray down the street and passed him off to another officer who was designated his arresting officer and was eventually listed on all of Gray’s arrest reports.</p><p>After being stripped of his equipment and re-cuffed, Gray waited on a prison transport bus with 50 to 60 others for half an hour until the rest of the seats were filled. He said he then waited an additional hour outside One Police Plaza due to the volume of arrestees that night.</p><p>“At this point, I feel like I’m just in the system and we’re going through with it, I’m being booked and that’s what’s happening. There’s nobody else there that I can speak to or remonstrate with,” Gray said.</p><p>After being processed, he was placed in a holding cell with 50-70 people crammed in shoulder-to-shoulder. Gray said that he still had a face mask in order to combat the spread of coronavirus, but most others did not.</p><p>Gray was released at around 9:30 a.m. — nearly 11 hours after his arrest — with a desk appearance ticket for unlawful assembly, a misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.</p><p>When asked for comment, an NYPD spokesperson directed the Tracker to the “30 minute mark” of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6eUFc_kltc"">a press briefing</a> held by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea on June 3.</p><p>Around that point in the recording, Shea says: “The only thing that I might add on the point of the press: We’re doing the best we can, the difficult situation. We 100 percent respect the rights of the press. Unfortunately we’ve had some people purporting to be press that are actually lying, if you can believe that. So sometimes these things take a second — maybe too long — to sort out.”</p><p>The Manhattan district attorney announced in a <a href=""https://www.manhattanda.org/d-a-vance-declines-to-prosecute-protest-arrests/"">press release</a> on June 5 that his office would not prosecute unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct arrests.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or who had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

The journalist was able to turn his head and the gas only got into his right eye, he said in that video.</p><p>“There’s no explanation of why they used this kind of force,” Turgiev told Sputnik.</p><p>Also that evening, police fired a rubber bullet that hit Canadian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent Susan Ormiston in her shoulder, and fired an unidentified canister that hit her in the buttocks, she said in <a href=""https://twitter.com/mcquillanator/status/1266915485741993996"">a report</a> for the broadcaster.

Thomas, a veteran of The Commercial Appeal, Indianapolis Star, Tennessean, and the Charlotte Observer, founded MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, a nonprofit news site “focused on poverty, power and public policy — issues about which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. cared deeply.”</p><p>Filed in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Tennessee, the <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Thomas-v.-City-of-Memphis-complaint-5-13-2020.pdf"">lawsuit</a> alleges that sometime after Jan. 22, 2018, Thomas’ personal gmail address was dropped from Mayor Jim Strickland’s media advisory list without her knowledge.</p><p>Thomas later realized she was no longer receiving the emails and began requesting to be added back to the list beginning in May 2019.</p><p>“Can you please confirm that the following email addresses have been added to any and all media advisory/distribution lists sent by any and all city departments?” she wrote on Oct. 29, 2019, in her second email requesting that her email account and two others for her publication be added to the list, according to an exhibit. This email, like all her other messages on the matter, received no reply, according to the complaint.</p><p>She also made these requests in person at a October 2019 event, and in voicemails and text messages the following month. On Jan. 14, 2020, she sent her seventh email requesting to be returned to the list.</p><p>When asked for comment, Thomas referred the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker to the website’s article about the lawsuit:</p><p>“I’m disappointed that it’s come to this, since the fix is so simple: Just treat me and MLK50 like you treat other journalists and news outlets,” Thomas wrote in the published <a href=""https://mlk50.com/mlk50-editor-sues-city-of-memphis-mayor-over-exclusion-from-media-list-ad3a87611db"">statement</a>.</p><p>Thomas’s attorney, Paul McAdoo, a Tennessee-based attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, argued in the lawsuit that the exclusion from the list interferes with Thomas’s ability to exercise her First Amendment rights.</p><p>“The exclusion of Ms. Thomas from the Media Advisory List substantially disrupts and interferes with her ability to gather news and report on the City and Mayor Strickland,” the complaint states.</p><p>Recently, Thomas’s exclusion from the email list has meant she has not been able to attend the city’s virtual COVID-19 briefings via Zoom.</p><p>The complaint alleges that Thomas was removed from the list due to her past coverage of the mayor and the city. When Thomas sought to interview Strickland in June 2017 about the one-year anniversary of a protest on Memphis’ Hernando De Soto Bridge, her request was denied.</p><p>In denying the request, Ursula Madden, the city’s chief communications officer, wrote to her that she had “demonstrated, particularly on social media, that you are not objective when it comes to Mayor Strickland,” according to the complaint.</p><p>Prior to filing the lawsuit, attorney McAdoo wrote two letters to the city’s chief legal officer, informing her of Thomas’s exclusion from the media advisory list and asking for this “infringing, discriminatory, and possibly retaliatory decision by the City” to be remedied.</p><p>“MLK50: Justice Through Journalism is doing important investigative reporting about issues affecting the residents of Memphis, and it is flatly unconstitutional for the city to disrupt and interfere with Ms. Thomas’s ability to gather and report the news because it doesn’t like the content of her reporting,” McAdoo said in a statement <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/mlk50-media-advisory-list-lawsuit/"">published</a> by RCFP.</p><p>Through her lawsuit, Thomas is seeking to be added to the email distribution list, that “explicit and meaningful standards” for inclusion of a media organization or reporter on the list be established, and that her exclusion from the list be declared unconstitutional.</p><p>City spokesman Dan Springer did not return an emailed request for comment about the lawsuit, but <a href=""https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2020/05/14/mlk-50-files-lawsuit-against-memphis-constitutional-violations/5189754002/"">told</a> the Commercial Appeal that the city does not comment on ongoing legal matters.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2020-05-22_at_12.24.1.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the lawsuit filed by Wendi Thomas of MLK50 against Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and others seeking to be added to the mayor&#x27;s media advisory email list.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,Mayor Jim Strickland

The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/hart-island-mass-graves-coronavirus-new-york/2020/04/16/a0c413ee-7f5f-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html"">reported</a> that since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, burials on the island have grown from an average of 25 per week to a peak of 120. While access to the island is usually limited, during the pandemic it has been completely shut off to the press, Gothamist <a href=""https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-seizes-drone-photojournalist-documenting-mass-burials-hart-island"">reported</a>.</p><p>Steinmetz told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he was piloting his drone at dawn on that Tuesday from a parking lot in City Island in the Bronx, which is a half mile away from Hart Island. He was accompanied by a CBS News journalist, as the outlet was doing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rr0Tsijtr0"">a video piece</a> on Steinmetz and his photography of the city amid COVID-19.</p><p>Minutes after starting to take pictures of the island, a group of plainclothes NYPD officers exited an unmarked van and told him to land the drone, Steinmetz said.</p><p>The officers initially demanded that Steinmetz show them the photos he had taken, which he did, and then asked him to turn over his memory card. He told the Tracker he refused.</p><p>Steinmetz said that the officers did not work at the local precinct, and therefore he waited with them in the parking lot for nearly an hour until another officer could bring the correct paperwork to seize the drone and censure Steinmetz.</p><p>Ultimately, in addition to the seizure of his $1,500 drone, the officers issued Steinmetz a misdemeanor summons for “avigation,” a law which prevents private individuals from launching drones anywhere in the metro area that isn’t an airport. According to Steinmetz, he faces up to a $1,000 fine for violating the regulation.</p><p>“The law about avigation is really written for flying over densely populated parts of New York City — like lower Manhattan — where with all the radio and cell traffic and microwaves it’s possible to lose contact with the drone or it could crash into a building and fall onto people’s heads,” Steinmetz said.</p><p>Steinmetz said that since the drone was flying over the water, it couldn’t endanger anyone.</p><p>“It was clear to me that they were trying to harass the press,” he said.</p><p>Mickey Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association, told the Tracker that while Steinmetz has a FAA license to pilot a drone, that only prevents him from running afoul of the federal regulations. That does not matter under the city’s avigation restrictions, Osterreicher said.</p><p>“In one sense, I understand why the police see the drone as evidence, but in another sense it’s like taking a journalist’s camera: This is a device that he or she is using to gather and disseminate news and by taking it from them it is depriving them of the ability to do that, because drones are not inexpensive,” Osterreicher said.</p><p>When asked about the return of Steinmetz’s drone and maximum penalties for violating the avigation law, an NYPD spokesperson emailed this statement: “Drones are illegal to fly in New York City except for authorized areas. The areas approved for flying drones are very limited and set by the FAA.”</p><p>Osterreicher noted that Steinmetz is the second journalist whose drone was seized while attempting to photograph Hart Island in recent weeks. He added that police returned the drone to the first photojournalist the following day, but declined to publicly identify that journalist. As of publication, Steinmetz’s drone had not been returned.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections, which oversees Hart Island and typically conducts the burials, told Gothamist in a statement, &quot;Out of respect to the families and friends of those buried on Hart Island, we have a longstanding policy of not permitting photography of an active burial site from Hart Island. It is disrespectful.&quot;</p><p>Mayoral spokesperson Olivia Lapeyrolerie told Gothamist that Bill de Blasio’s administration is exploring ways of granting press access to Hart Island burials safely.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTS38JML.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>Drone images of bodies being buried on New York&#x27;s Hart Island were captured on April 9.

Bennett also noted that the data cited in the graphic mentioned by the newsletter was drawn from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which has been used around the world.</p><p>&quot;Unlike China, VOA has stuck to verifiable facts, including publishing numerous articles in Mandarin, English and other languages that outed China&#x27;s initial secrecy keeping information of the initial outbreak from the world,&quot; Bennett wrote. &quot;VOA has thoroughly debunked much of the information coming from the Chinese government and government-controlled media.&quot;</p><p>It is unclear what triggered the White House’s targeting of the outlet. However, on April 9 — the day before the newsletter went out — Dan Scavino, an adviser to President Donald Trump who handles his social media strategy, retweeted VOA’s post on the end of the quarantine in Wuhan. In his <a href=""https://twitter.com/Scavino45/status/1248248406167830528"">post</a>, Scavino accused VOA of parroting Chinese propaganda and called the outlet a “disgrace.”</p><p>Committee to Protect Journalists Executive Director Joel Simon condemned the newsletter in <a href=""https://cpj.org/2020/04/trumps-white-house-blasts-voa-for-promoting-propag.php"">a statement</a> and said the attack was appalling.</p><p>“It is outrageous that the White House is attacking Voice of America, which has a tradition of reporting stories that challenge the narratives of authoritarian regimes around the world,” Simon said. “At this moment, citizens in some highly censored countries are depending for their health and safety on VOA news of the coronavirus, and President Trump should absolutely not undermine the news outlet’s efforts to do its job.”</p><p>While VOA has not been directly targeted by the president on Twitter, Trump went on a rant against the outlet during a press briefing in the Rose Garden on April 15, several days after the newsletter was published, Business Insider <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-threatens-to-adjourn-congress-rants-against-voice-of-america-2020-4"">reported</a>.</p><p>&quot;If you hear what&#x27;s coming out of the Voice of America, it&#x27;s disgusting,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The things they say are disgusting to our country.&quot;</p><p>At the same briefing, the president also railed against Congress for failing to confirm various nominees including Michael Pack, whom the president nominated to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA.

Ron DeSantis on the COVID-19 pandemic at the state capitol in Tallahassee on March 28, 2020.</p><p>Mary Ellen Klas — the Miami Herald&#x27;s Tallahassee bureau chief, who also reports for the Tampa Bay Times — was denied entry to the capitol to attend DeSantis&#x27; news briefing, where Florida&#x27;s lieutenant governor, director of emergency management and state surgeon general also appeared.</p><p>Outside of the capitol, Meredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, told Klas she could not attend because she had previously requested &quot;social distancing&quot; at these briefings. Beatrice said the briefings were available to view on Florida Channel, a government access television network.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>“I asked for social distancing. I didn’t ask to be excluded,” Klas said in a <a href=""https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article241591161.html"">story</a> about the incident by the Miami Herald&#x27;s David Smiley.</p><p>A few days prior, Klas had requested that the governor&#x27;s news briefings, in accordance with public health guidelines, be modified to allow for practicing social distancing. One option she suggested was moving them to a Zoom-style videoconference where reporters would have the opportunity to ask questions without having to meet in close quarters, according to the Herald’s <a href=""https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article241591161.html"">story</a>.</p><p>This request was repeated in<a href=""https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article241591266.ece/BINARY/Letter%20to%20DeSantis.pdf#storylink=readmore_inline""> writing</a> in a March 20 letter signed by editors from the Miami Herald, Tampa Bay Times, el Nuevo Herald, Bradenton Herald, Palm Beach Post, Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel.</p><p>&quot;The briefing room at the Emergency Operations Center is typically packed with reporters in a room about 15-20 feet wide. Reporters are seated in chairs close together. At the Wednesday briefing, there were 22 reporters and photographers in the room,&quot; the letter stated. &quot;We’d ask, respectfully, that the state move these briefings to a larger space to accommodate all reporters in person and at recommended distances. Alternatively, we would ask that the state set up a small pool of reporters for each briefing along with the ability for the governor and staff to take questions from press corps members outside the room through a live-stream. Either option, or a combination of both, would preserve access to these critical meetings and ensure a safer environment for all concerned.&quot;</p><p>That letter did not receive a reply, but briefings were subsequently moved to the governor’s office at the capitol, where a hand-selected group of reporters were invited to attend and everyone else could watch via livestream, Klas told the Committee to Protect Journalists. Klas and others were able to submit questions in writing, but did not have any of them answered. So Klas decided to attend the March 28 briefing in person, but was turned away.</p><p>But a television reporter waiting outside the capitol, Mike Vasilinda, was allowed in to the press conference after a Florida Department of Law Enforcement drove out to pick him up, Klas <a href=""https://twitter.com/MaryEllenKlas/status/1243974180082769921?s=20"">tweeted</a>.</p><p>On Twitter, Klas posted the questions she had planned to ask DeSantis at the press conference:</p></div></div>

A third deposition ordered that the “person most knowledgeable for defendant Friends for Fullerton’s Future” appear for questioning on March 26. The order said topics of discussion would include the structure of the blog, who its contributors are and the sources of all city documents posted to the blog.</p><p>Ferguson told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that no such individual exists.</p><p>“Nobody runs this blog, it’s a blog,” he said. “We do do journalistic work insofar as we report on stories — we do break stories, we do have people that we talk to — but we don’t have an official structure: I don’t have an editor.”</p><p>The blog’s attorney, Kelly Aviles, told the Tracker that a deposition order such as this is standard legal procedure when seeking information from an entity. She also said that all three orders were invalid because they were improperly filed after the city had received notice of her clients’ appeal, which stays, or pauses, all pending matters.</p><p>Kimberly Hall Barlow, attorney for the City of Fullerton, told the Tracker the orders were filed properly and that they will continue to pursue the depositions as part of the discovery process.</p><p>The deposition order, reviewed by the Tracker, demands that the individual — or entity in this case — bring numerous documents and communications related to the city’s allegations, including around the use or possession of nearly two dozen files from the city’s Dropbox, the IP addresses for all its computers and electronic devices, Dropbox activity logs and private browser use.</p><p>It also commands the production of all documents, including communications, relating to the blog’s argument that the city’s Dropbox was accessible to the public at large, and that accessing it was part of routine newsgathering.</p><p>The deposition also focuses on communications around 15 public records requests, six of which were filed by Ferguson and one by Curlee.

The attempt to subvert California’s shield law and reporter’s privilege protections are concerning, she said.</p><p>“Not only is the entire case so outrageous that a government agency would come after an organization that was reporting on it in this fashion, claiming that they committed crimes by accessing documents that the city put on a website without any kind of protection, but then all of these procedural maneuverings by the city that have just tried to make it more difficult for the journalists — I think that is especially troubling.”</p><p>Aviles told the Tracker that she hopes all filings in the appeal will be complete in the next two to three months.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/FFFF.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the subpoena demanding documents and work product from the blog Friends for Fullerton&#x27;s Future</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['IGNORED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Friends for Fullerton's Future,,,,,,,

Law enforcement officers went to the journalist&#x27;s home, put him and his wife in separate police cars, where the journalist explained &quot;he had been receiving threats because he was a journalist that wrote about white supremacists,&quot; according to the affidavit.</p><p>Following Denton’s February 2020 arrest, Magistrate Judge Nancy K.

WKBW hired private security for them and had the family stay in a hotel for a week as prosecutors opened an investigation and assigned an FBI field officer to investigate.</p><p>“It was clear that this wasn’t someone who got upset with a news broadcast and did a spur of the moment thing. This was persistent and it seemed like this guy really had it out for me. That’s what really worried us,” Specht said.</p><p>The caller, eventually identified as adjunct seminary professor Paul Lubienecki, was arrested and charged with cyberstalking on Feb. 12, accused of making 11 “harassing” phone calls to Specht between August 2019 and February 2020, according to a complaint filed against Lubienecki. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p><p>Specht told WKBW that he was grateful the FBI made the investigation a priority.</p><p>“Criticism of news reporting is acceptable and even welcomed. But making personal threats against a reporter for simply doing his job goes against the entire American belief in a free press,” he said.</p><p>Bishop Edward Scharfenberger, whom the Pope appointed as interim administrator for the diocese, condemned the threats against Specht in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/BuffaloDiocese/status/1227947700777357312"">series</a> of <a href=""https://twitter.com/BuffaloDiocese/status/1227947703260372993"">tweets</a>.</p><p>“There is no place — nor should there be any tolerance — for threats or harassment towards members of the news media or any one else. This is against who we are as Christians, but also against our nation’s founding principles that guarantee freedom to the press and freedom of speech,” Scharfenberger wrote.</p><p>Lubienecki was released on a $2,500 bond to await trial. The judge in the case <a href=""https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/defense-considers-options-for-man-accused-in-death-threat-of-i-team-reporter"">granted</a> a 60-day adjournment for Lubienecki and his attorney to consider possible defenses, and he is scheduled back in court on April 24.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Specht.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>A portion of the criminal complaint against a Buffalo, New York, man for allegedly cyberstalking a reporter</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, vice chair of the Senate Conservation Committee, interrupted the chair to note that Knapp was filming and ask if she had received permission or would like to request it. While committee meetings are streamed through a webcast, Senate rules at the time barred anyone from photographing or recording audio or video without permission from the committee chair. KRQE reported that it never saw the rule enforced, and that a sign posted outside the room to notify the public of the policy noted that the news media was exempt.</p><p>“I figured, it was a public meeting,” Knapp said, identifying herself as a member of the press. A second senator then expressed opposition to her filming, according to KRQE.</p><p>“I just prefer this not to be spliced and edited to be used against someone and have someone not be totally truthful in their comments in a bill because they’re worried how something might be splashed and cut in a newscast,” Sen. Pat Woods said.</p><p>Seconds later, Sedillo Lopez said, “OK, I’m sorry but I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”</p><p>KRQE reported that the sign noting media exemption was removed after its broadcast about the incident.</p><p>Bill Anderson, general manager of KRQE, <a href=""https://www.abqjournal.com/1419708/booting-reporter-from-senate-hearing-was-the-wrong-call.html"">told the Albuquerque Journal</a> that the incident was unacceptable, adding that he assumed it was an “error in judgement.”</p><p>“Nothing good happens in government when these people close the door and want to talk when no one’s listening,” Anderson said.</p><p>Sen. Jeff Steinborn told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that Sedillo Lopez had overstepped the bounds of the policy by asking Knapp to leave.</p><p>“The rule doesn’t allow for that at all,” Steinborn said. “That incident was rightfully embarrassing to the institution: It shined a light on the problem and made it an imperative to fix it.”</p><p>In late January, Steinborn had proposed a resolution to change the rule and allow for both the public and media to record and photograph meetings. The resolution <a href=""https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=S&amp;legType=R&amp;legNo=2&amp;year=20"">passed without opposition</a> on Feb. 12, after the incident with Knapp.</p></div></div>

A few moments later, the same aid asked Kelly to follow her into Pompeo’s private living room at the State Department without a recorder, not specifying that the conversation would be off the record.</p><p>“He shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the [9-minute] interview itself had lasted,” Kelly <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/01/24/799244678/pompeo-wont-say-whether-he-owes-yovanovitch-an-apology-i-ve-done-what-s-right"">told</a> her “All Things Considered” co-host Ari Shapiro. “He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.

The letter, shared with the Tracker, advised Hixenbaugh and NBC Nightly News producer Janelle Richards that the disclosure of a confidential file is a criminal offense punishable by up to 6 months imprisonment and up to a $1,000 fine, under <a href=""https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/48/XX/981/7"">state law</a>.</p><p>“Please cease and desist immediately from any further illegal use and disclosure of the documents in the child abuse investigation file illegally disclosed to you, and any information obtained in that file,” wrote the agency’s chief legal counsel Therese Durkin. “Failure to comply will lead to further legal action.”</p><p>Hixenbaugh told the Tracker that in all of his reporting on child protective services across the country, never before had a state agency reached out to block his reporting or threaten him.</p><p>“It was unusual and surprising to receive a letter that suggested that I could be imprisoned for doing journalism,” he said.</p><p>NBC attorney Alexander Ziccardi emailed a response to the letter, noting that the agency had falsely assumed the information used in the outlet’s reporting could only have been obtained from a confidential report.</p><p>“[V]irtually all of that information is available from alternative sources that are entirely independent of the CPS investigation file,” he wrote.

A brief scuffle ensued as Plante attempted to keep Carzis at a distance, according to his accounting of the attack.</p><p>“When he was throwing punches at me, I was kind of laughing a little bit because I’m not afraid of a guy like that,” Plante said. “So what was going through my mind was, ‘Block the punches, block the kicks, get it all on video tape and expose this guy for who he is.’ And I believe that’s what happened.”</p><p>Carzis did land a blow against him, Plante said, resulting in a small cut on his nose from a piece of jewelry Carzis was wearing.

Fox News retracted the article a week later.</p><p>In 2018, Aaron Rich sued Edward Butowsky, Matthew Couch and America First Media, alleging that they had defamed him by publishing false statements about his purported involvement in such a plot and prior knowledge of his brother’s murder.</p><p>According to a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6876399-AaronRich-177.html"">court order</a> reviewed by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Aaron Rich alleges that journalist Zimmerman was in frequent contact with Butowsky both before and after her article was retracted.

Zimmerman could not be reached for comment.</p><p>The January deposition subpoena orders Zimmerman to provide testimony concerning her communications with Butowsky, any knowledge she may have as to whether he acted intentionally or recklessly and Fox News’ decision-making process behind the retraction.</p><p>On Jan. 15, Fox and Zimmerman moved for a protective order barring her deposition on the basis that her testimony is protected by newsgathering privilege under the First Amendment and New York’s reporter shield law.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Richard Leon denied their motion on March 25, 2020.</p><p>In his April 9 order explaining that decision, Leon wrote that Zimmerman’s communications with Butowsky were not protected because he was not her source (nor had Zimmerman claimed that he was), and that in sharing information with Butowsky she “waived any newsgathering privilege.”</p><p>Leon also stipulated that the outlet’s decision to retract Zimmerman’s article is not privileged, and even if it were, Aaron Rich had demonstrated the centrality of her testimony to his case.</p><p>Fox and Zimmerman filed a motion for the court to reconsider its decision on April 22. Attorneys for Fox News and Zimmerman declined to comment.</p><p>In the <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6876401-Zimmerman.html"">motion</a>, reviewed by the Tracker, they argue that Judge Leon took an “unduly narrow” view of what is protected by reporter’s privilege. Butowsky — even though he is not quoted in Zimmerman’s piece — should still be considered a source, they said, and the decision to retract an article is made through the same editorial process as the decision to publish.</p><p>Fox and Zimmerman urged Leon, if he remained unmoved by those arguments, to vacate his rulings on those issues and to rest his decision to allow Zimmerman’s deposition solely on the determination that Rich had overcome her reporter’s privilege.</p><p>“Those questions concerning scope and waiver of the privilege have constitutional dimension, as well as implications for journalists beyond the confines of this dispute, and they should not be decided unless it is necessary for the Court to do so,” the motion reads.</p><p>As of this writing, no decision has been reached on this latest motion.</p><p>The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a Tracker partner organization, <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/seth-rich-lawsuit-implications/"">wrote</a> that the ruling could pose significant First Amendment issues if not rolled back.</p><p>“Far from not being part of the editorial process in newsgathering, as the district court found, the decision to retract a story is perhaps the most ‘weighty’ exercise of editorial judgment there is,” writes Gabe Rottman, director of RCFP’s Technology and Press Freedom Project.</p><p>“To allow that holding to stand would discourage all news organizations from having these discussions, which would harm newsgathering and the free flow of true information to the public.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Zimmerman.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the motion asking a judge to reconsider an order allowing the deposition of Fox News journalist Malia Zimmerman</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['PENDING'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

After receiving an email from Twitter notifying him that his account was implicated, Davis <a href=""https://twitter.com/charliearchy/status/1220880468695908352"">tweeted</a> that he was named in retaliation for <a href=""https://medium.com/@charlesdavis/trevor-fitzgibbon-used-to-run-a-major-progressive-public-relations-firm-representing-clients-from-25e93256217f"">his reporting</a> on FitzGibbon in 2017. Davis shared a copy of the subpoena with the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker and said that he sent a statement to Twitter noting that he objected to the subpoena.</p><p>“It is legal harassment,” Davis said. “And while Twitter seems committed to defending its users, it also makes me think it might be time to switch to encrypted messaging apps like Signal for any conversation, sensitive or not.”</p><p>Other accounts named in the subpoena include those of numerous satirists, activists and lawyers as well as Andrew Stepanian of Sparrow Media. Stepanian told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he does not identify as a journalist. A blogger who did not respond to the Tracker’s requests for comment was also named.</p><p>Twitter filed <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QM3QgyGMAB1rkOKv5fDdLBknWoQYZW5N/view"">a memorandum in support</a> of quashing the subpoena on Feb. 4, 2020, stating, “The Subpoena suffers from a litany of substantive defects and must be quashed.”</p><p>In reference to the request for direct communications, Twitter argued FitzGibbon’s lawyer Steven Biss both sought irrelevant information or information that should be obtained from Radack, and placed an undue burden on the company.</p><p>In its memorandum, Twitter mentions that its counsel met with Biss twice, raising issues with the subpoena and requesting that he withdraw it. According to Twitter, Biss refused. In an email exchange following the second meeting, FitzGibbon’s counsel again refused to withdraw the subpoena, but narrowed the request to Radack’s communications with 17 accounts.</p><p>It is unclear whether reporter Davis’ Twitter account is still listed in the revised subpoena. Biss did not return the Tracker’s request for comment.</p><p>FitzGibbon’s underlying case against Radack is scheduled to go to trial on July 13, and all evidence must be finalized by June 29, including information gained from discovery subpoenas.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/FitzGibbon.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>A portion of the subpoena seeking, among other things, private Twitter messages between nearly two dozen accounts.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['PENDING'],None,None,Twitter,tech company,subpoena,None,,,,,,,,

The provision of the act cited pertains to the digital transfer of information and metadata, which the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/nypd-patriot-act-subpoena"">noted</a> is one of the most obscure sections.</p><p>NYPD spokesperson Sgt.

McRorie declined to answer further questions on the focus of the subpoena and why the Patriot Act was cited.</p><p>Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement, “Using the Patriot Act to subpoena a journalist’s social media data is not only a gross overstep by the New York Police Department, it is reminiscent of how countries without democratic safeguards use anti-terrorism laws to dampen or retaliate against critical journalism.”</p><p>In early February 2020, Twitter notified Moore of the subpoena. The social media company confirmed to the Tracker that it did not comply with the subpoena.</p><p>The NYPD withdrew the request on Feb. 13, after attorneys for the Post contacted the department, the Post reported.</p><p>Moore declined to comment.</p><p>In a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/nyregion/patriot-act-subpoena-nypd.html"">statement to The New York Times</a>, Post spokeswoman Iva Benson said the police department’s actions were “antithetical to a free press.”</p><p>“The Patriot Act was passed to make it easier to prevent deadly terror attacks, not help the government crack down on people who speak to reporters,” Benson said.</p><p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href=""https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2020/02/18/mondays-with-the-mayor-bill-de-blasio-trump-sanctuary-cities-slams-deployment-of-border-patrol"">said on NY1</a> show “Inside City Hall” that the subpoena was a mistake.</p><p>“I think the effort to ensure that information that is not public is kept confidential — that’s fair.

It would essentially require, in Alice and Wonderland fashion, a &#x27;libel trial&#x27; prior to the publication of an article. Such a process would eviscerate the First Amendment&#x27;s prohibition of prior restraints on publication.&quot;</p><p>Buchan made these arguments at a hearing before judge Bell on the afternoon of Nov. 14. “You don’t keep the news media in this country from publishing truthful—or what they believe to be truthful—information in this country,” Buchan told the court, <a href=""https://www.wbtv.com/2019/11/14/judge-issues-lifts-restraining-order-preventing-wbtv-investigation-airing/"">according</a> to WBTV.</p><p>Rainey, the attorney for SL Recovery, told the judge that this was not a case of prior restraint. “There hasn’t been a prior restraint at any level,” he said in court. If the restraining order were lifted, Rainey continued, “The court would be tacitly permitting them to make ongoing libelous statements.&quot;</p><p>Buchan countered at the hearing that the law affords injured parties the opportunity to file a lawsuit for defamation, should that occur, but restraining speech by blocking publication would set a dangerous precedent. “That’s not how the First Amendment was designed to work or has ever worked,” Buchan said. “When he says this is not a prior restraint, this is the definition of a prior restraint.”</p><p>Bell granted Buchan’s motion to dissolve the restraining order. “I conclude that the court was in error in granting a temporary restraining order,” Bell said as she announced her ruling.</p><p>“At the time she signed the restraining order, Bell said, she thought the potential significant harm to SL Recovery outweighed the potential harm to WBTV by having to hold its story,” WBTV reported.</p><p>“At that point alone, I stand corrected,” Bell said.</p><p>In a statement emailed to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Hodges said the experience was a shocking one. “It paralyzed me, but only for a minute before the news team at WBTV went to work defending the first amendment to make sure our story would air on-time,” he wrote. “Time and money are in short supply for any newsroom and are better spent reporting for our community than fighting legal battles already decided by the Supreme Court.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-20_at_12.45.2.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the motion to disolve the temporary restraining order placed on WBTV&#x27;s report</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,struck down,,,,,,,,

The source also claimed to have a copy of the police report from that arrest. In a response to a request for comment, Pishevar confirmed his arrest in a statement to Fast Company.</p><p>Information provided by the source and contained in the alleged police report was used in an article published by Fast Company in November 2017, having received inconclusive responses from the City of London Police concerning the document’s authenticity. The police report was later proven to be fabricated.</p><p>Fast Company <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/fast-company-subpoenaed-identifying-information-confidential-source/"">received a subpoena</a> from lawyers representing Pishevar in August 2019, seeking information they hoped to use in possible future court cases, or “contemplated criminal and civil proceedings in England,” according to a memorandum of law obtained by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>General counsel for the magazine largely complied with the subpoena and follow up emails from Pishevar’s attorneys. They did not, however, provide identifying information about Baram’s confidential source, stating that Baram claimed reporter’s privilege under New York’s shield law.</p><p>Lucas Bento, an attorney for Pishevar, acknowledged that identifying information about the source was the central aim of the subpoena, and threatened to pursue a court-ordered deposition of Baram if Fast Company did not provide the identifying information voluntarily.</p><p>Bento followed through on this threat on Oct. 31, filing an application for discovery for documents, communications and testimony from Baram. The application, which is the process by which subpoenas are issued by foreign parties and approved by U.S. courts, was obtained and reviewed by the Tracker.</p><p>In an affidavit opposing the application filed on Dec. 4, Baram said that he often relies on speaking with sources on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>“My ability to report on matters of public interest depends on my ability to safeguard the identities of my sources and the confidentiality of the information that they provide.

Aviles told CPJ in December that the suit could go to a jury trial in early 2020. The press freedom and legal advocacy group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/tech-press-freedom-11-3-2019/"">called</a> the case the “first … we’re aware of where the computer crime laws have been misused so brazenly against members of the news media.”</p><p>The City of Fullerton claims that the blog, Friends for Fullerton’s Future, and two of its journalists, Joshua Ferguson and David Curlee, accessed more than a dozen internal documents stored on the file hosting and sharing service Dropbox without permission, according to CPJ’s review. The blog <a href=""https://www.fullertonsfuture.org/2019/fullerton-police-cut-a-deal-to-bypass-the-law/"">publishes</a> original articles and commentary on the city government and the local police department<i>.</i></p><p>Aviles alleged, in a phone interview with CPJ, that the case is designed to retaliate against her clients for reporting and to block future publication. She told CPJ she has filed an anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation motion, or SLAPP, which permits courts to dismiss lawsuits that are intended to censor public speech.</p><p>“The City’s suit was not in retaliation for anything,” Fullerton’s lawyer Kimberly Hall Barlow wrote in an email to CPJ. The blog was not a factor in the decision to bring the case, she said.</p><p>“If the argument is that a reporter can steal information him or herself and then be allowed to publish it at will, that is neither consistent with the first amendment law nor the ethical tenets of professional journalists,” she said.</p><p>Ferguson routinely requested public records, and the city had provided him with a link to the Dropbox folder in the past, he told CPJ. The city acknowledges sending a link to access the folder in response to records requests, according to court filings reviewed by CPJ. The folder was not password protected, and anyone could access it via the web address in the link. Files that were approved for public release were kept in the same folder as others that had not been, some of which were password protected, according to those documents.</p><p>The complaint said Ferguson and Curlee accessed files in the folder that had not been approved for release, thereby violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law intended to combat hacking, and a similar state law, the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. CPJ has <a href=""https://cpj.org/blog/2019/06/tech-journalists-troubled-assange-CFAA-charge.php"">reported</a> concerns that the CFAA’s broad wording could be used to punish routine online journalistic activity.</p><p>The complaint said the journalists had intentionally obscured their activity using a virtual private network and the Tor browser — digital security tools that CPJ and others routinely <a href=""https://cpj.org/2019/07/digital-safety-kit-journalists.php"">recommend</a> that journalists use online. The City also requested a forensic analysis of the reporters’ computers and sought prior restraint to block future publication based on the files — a request that RCFP called “concerning” and Aviles called unconstitutional in court documents.</p><p>In November, a trial court in Orange County did not allow that forensic examination, according to Aviles, while an appeals court <a href=""https://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=43&amp;doc_id=2302187&amp;doc_no=G058506&amp;request_token=OCIwLSIkTkg9WzBZSCItUEtIUFw7UFxbJiBeUzpSXDtOCg%3D%3D"">stayed</a> the attempt to block future publication in December. But the anti-hacking lawsuit against the blog is ongoing, Aviles told CPJ.</p><p>“The city is calling me a hacker and a thief,” Ferguson told CPJ in December. Yet, he said, “the idea they are presenting — that hacking is just clicking a link — that idea would literally break the internet if broadly applied.”</p><p>“The conduct that the City complains of is no more criminal than clicking through the City’s website, finding confidential information, and downloading it,” Aviles wrote in court filings reviewed by CPJ. The city’s lawsuit is in “retaliation for Mr. Ferguson’s CPRA lawsuit and to silence the Blog,” she wrote. Immediately before the city launched its lawsuit, Ferguson had filed a California Public Records Act lawsuit requesting the release of documents related to alleged police misconduct, he told CPJ.</p><p>Kimberly Hall Barlow told CPJ that the city decided to file their suit before Ferguson filed his.</p><p>Ferguson told CPJ that the city’s complaint included Christopher Tennyson, his former co-worker at a local camera store where they sometimes shared the same computer, in order to damage Ferguson’s professional relationships. Kimberly Hall Barlow denied this, noting to CPJ that the city later dropped Tennyson from the suit.</p><p>Aviles said the case was draining her clients’ financial resources and impeding their ability to continue reporting.</p><p>“It would be hard for a large newspaper to deal with this,” Aviles told CPJ in November. “But for a blog of concerned citizen journalists — who felt like there was no voice in their community — it’s an outrageous thing to face.”</p><p>RCFP <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/briefs-comments/friends-for-fullertons-future/"">filed</a> an amicus brief in support of the bloggers, as <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/G058506-Fullerton-amicus-brief-of-EFF.pdf"">did</a> the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a leading U.S. digital rights group.

Other than it looks to me like there’s no original reporting here, you just read Twitter and other people’s stuff, which I guess is why you don’t pick up the phone when people call from the White House because, if it’s not on Twitter or it’s not on cable TV, it’s not real.”</p><p>Conway also accused Yilek of “trying to undercut another woman based on who she’s married to,” and dismissed Yilek’s explanations of why information about George Conway was considered important contextual information.</p><p>Near the end of the call, Conway said: “Listen, if you’re going to cover my personal life, then we’re welcome to do the same around here.” Yilek <a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/powerful-woman-kellyanne-conway-mocks-and-threatens-reporter-for-mentioning-her-husband-audio/"">later characterized</a> the statement as a threat that “the White House would delve into the personal lives of reporters if they wrote about her husband.”</p><p>Conway disputed Yilek’s version of events, <a href=""https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1187502654026604547?s=20"">saying in a lengthy statement</a>, “What I said on that call I’ve said publicly on-the-record before, including on TV, in speeches, in driveway gaggles with reporters.

I’m so f------ glad we got Osuna!” directing his comments at three female reporters nearby, one of whom was wearing a purple rubber domestic violence-awareness bracelet.</p><p>Pitcher Roberto Osuna was a Toronto Blue Jay when he was suspended without pay for 75 games during the 2018 season for violating Major League Baseball&#x27;s domestic violence policy. Osuna had been accused of assaulting the mother of his three-year-old child. The Astros hired Osuna near the end of that suspension despite having a &quot;zero tolerance policy&quot; against domestic violence, drawing widespread criticism.</p><p>Sports Illustrated&#x27;s Stephanie Apstein, one of the reporters at whom Taubman directed his remarks, published a<a href=""https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/houston-astros-roberto-osuna-suspension""> story</a> on Oct. 21 describing Taubman&#x27;s outburst and putting it in broader context.</p><p>&quot;The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized. The Astros declined to comment. They also declined to make Taubman available for an interview,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Taubman&#x27;s timing was odd,&quot; Apstein continued, as Osuna had not performed well that evening. &quot;He had been, by Baseball Reference’s calculations and any intelligent observer’s assessment, the least valuable Astro that night. So why would Taubman choose that moment, to taunt that demographic? It’s not hard to figure out.&quot;</p><p>But for his arrest for domestic violence, Osuna would likely have never become an Astro, Apstein continued. &quot;Osuna was one of the best closers in the game, and his infraction made him, in the mind of the Astros’ front office, a distressed asset. They traded for him, and in terms of traditional organizational capital, the price was low: the Astros gave up their own struggling closer and two middling pitching prospects for him,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But the price was low for a reason: Many teams didn’t want to deal with the public backlash for acquiring Osuna.&quot;</p><p>The Houston Chronicle reported that Taubman’s comments were directed at one particular female reporter. “In casual conversations at the end of the 2018 season, Taubman complained about the reporter to multiple people,” the Chronicle <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/astros/article/Astros-GM-Jeff-Luhnow-describes-different-14557067.php?utm_source=article&amp;utm_campaign=AOA"">reported</a>, without naming the individual in question.</p><p>After Apstein&#x27;s story was published, the Astros put out a statement accusing the reporter of fabrication: &quot;The story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible,&quot; the<a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHcvIdRXkAAm7Rx.jpg""> statement</a> began, attributing Taubman&#x27;s comments to &quot;the game situation that had just occurred and nothing else -- they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated&#x27;s attempts to fabricate a story where one does not exist.&quot;</p><p>Sports Illustrated came to Apstein&#x27;s defense in a<a href=""http://si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/sports-illustrated-statement-response-astros-story""> statement</a> the next day: &quot;Sports Illustrated unequivocally stands behind Apstein, her reporting and the story, which was subsequently corroborated by several other media members present at the scene. Any implication that SI or any of its journalists would ‘fabricate’ a story in its detail or intent is both disappointing and completely inexcusable.&quot;</p><p>Two days later, on Oct. 24, the Astros fired Taubman and tweeted out a mea culpa:</p></div></div>

The asylum seekers appear in the courtroom via teleconference.</p><p>This arrangement, however, means the journalists will be located at least 150 miles away from the migrants, rendering them unavailable for in-person interviews.</p><p>&quot;Just as it&#x27;s hard for judges to catch emotion and body language from a video hearing, it&#x27;s going to be hard for reporters to accurately describe the scene in a hearing room if we only have access to it via video conference,&quot; Flores said in a statement emailed to the Tracker. &quot;If there are technical issues inside one of the tent hearings we won&#x27;t know what it was like for the asylum-seekers there.

The town gained national fame when “Last Chance U,” a Netflix documentary series about junior college football teams, arrived in 2017 to chronicle the transformation of Independence Community College’s football program under new coach Jason Brown.</p><p>The Daily Reporter is a daily newspaper that publishes both online and in print, while the Chronicle is a weekly publication that doesn’t have a website. The Chronicle is edited by Andy Taylor, whose family has been in the newspaper business since the 1870s. Andy’s parents, Rudy and Kathy Taylor, are the paper’s owners and publishers.</p><p>Taylor told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the trouble began in October 2018, after he published an editorial critical of coach Brown and the ICC football team, which had <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155860302038716&amp;id=179343538715"">gotten into a physical fight with an opposing team</a> the month before.</p><p>A few weeks after the editorial was published, Taylor received an email from someone claiming to be “Richard Barnwell,” an attorney at The Cochran Firm, a well-known law firm in Los Angeles. The email threatened Taylor with a lawsuit if he continued to write about Brown. (Although Taylor said he could not share copies of the actual emails in advance of the trial, he was able to describe them in general terms.)</p><p>“It looked legit,” Taylor said of the email. “It had the guy’s [photograph] on there. It had a link to the firm’s website. It was just very typical of what you’d see in any cease-and-desist letter. It was typical in the language, where it would start out saying, ‘I represent Jason Brown at Independence Community College, he is my client, any continuing effort to defame or write anything that is negative toward my client will result in immediate litigation against you, please cease and desist.’”</p><p>The email spooked Taylor, who knew that his family’s small-town newspaper could not afford to defend an expensive defamation suit.</p><p>“My parents, who are in their mid-70s, own the newspaper,” Taylor said. “They’re the publishers. So I presented them the cease-and-desist letter, and they were very quick and swift in their decision. In fact, my father said, ‘Andy, you need to cool your jets!’ Meaning, stop being critical of Jason Brown.”</p><p>Fearful of a lawsuit, the Chronicle stopped running editorials and commentary critical of Brown and the ICC football program.</p><p>Then in February 2019, a student at ICC who had been cut from the football team reached out to Taylor with an explosive tip about Brown. The student, who was originally from Germany, told Taylor that Brown had berated him in front of his teammates and mocked his heritage. After the student complained about Brown’s behavior to ICC administrators, the coach sent him a text message: “I’m your new Hitler.” The student shared a copy of the text message with Taylor.</p><p>Soon after Taylor contacted ICC’s president for comment, he received another threatening email from “Richard Barnwell.”</p><p>Taylor said this email referenced the cease-and-desist language of the first email and again threatened a defamation and libel lawsuit if he investigated further.</p><p>This time, Taylor replied to the email. The response he got from “Barnwell” was unprofessional, full of misspelled words — including the word “chronicle” — and personal insults, which made him skeptical that the man on the other end of the email was really a professional attorney. Taylor also noticed that the emails supposedly from “Barnwell” were sent from a Yahoo email address, rather than an email address associated with The Cochran Firm.</p><p>Suspicious that someone was impersonating Barnwell, Taylor called the attorney’s office and explained the situation to his secretary. Barnwell soon left Taylor a voicemail confirming that the attorney had nothing to do with the emails and had never heard of Brown.</p><p>Taylor then contacted the county sheriff’s office and told them the whole story. In May, the sheriff’s office informed Taylor that it had obtained evidence tying the fake “Barnwell” account to Brown’s electronic devices. Taylor also learned that the same email account had targeted another local newspaper — the Daily Reporter — which had run an editorial cartoon mocking Brown.</p><p>On June 28, Brown was charged with four felony counts of blackmail, four felony counts of identity theft, and two misdemeanor counts of criminal false communication, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10156464185298716&amp;id=179343538715"">according to the Chronicle</a>.</p><p>A month later, Netflix released the fourth season of “Last Chance U.” The season details the text message incident and Brown’s subsequent firing but makes no mention the pending criminal charges against him.</p><p>Taylor plans to testify at Brown’s trial, which was originally scheduled to begin in October but has since been postponed to January 2020. Both Taylor and Josh Umholtz, the publisher of the Daily Reporter, and the Daily Reporter itself appear on a list of subpoenaed witnesses. No one from the Daily Reporter has returned request for comment as to whether the organization will comply with the subpoena.</p><p>Most subpoena cases documented on the Tracker involve journalists who are being compelled to testify, often about their reporting and their confidential sources, against their will. This case is different.</p><p>Taylor described his situation as “the flip side of the conventional argument against journalists testifying,” Taylor said, since it involves journalists being the victim of a criminal attempt to intimidate the press. He said he would testify voluntarily even if he had not been subpoenaed in the case.</p><p>“I just want to tell somebody, with my hand on my Bible and under oath, that I did my job, I did it well, and somebody didn’t like that and tried to put my pen away, and that doesn’t work in America,” he said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12.33.0.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>The Montgomery County Chronicle is one of two Kansas publications subpoenaed to testify in a criminal case against a community college football coach charged with blackmail, identity theft after allegedly sending false cease-and-desist emails.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['PENDING'],None,None,None,None,None,None,The Independence Daily Reporter,,,,,,,

The public is not allowed to record whatsoever.</p><p>Emily Wetherell, deputy clerk of the Vermont Supreme Court, told VTDigger that the new rules were made to modernize existing policies in the face of technological advances, particularly in regard to smartphones.</p><p>“The registration for media members, too, is a response to the power that cell phones give citizens in the courtroom,” Wetherell said. “That old rule was really just about media, because most people didn’t have the capability or the technology to record. But now most people can … and so in order to identify who media is, the committee decided that a registration process would be the most useful way of doing it.”</p><p>Mike Donoghue, executive director of the Vermont Press Association and vice president of the New England First Amendment Coalition, told VTDigger that while he understands the need to modernize the rules, he has concerns about how the judiciary will determine who is legitimately a member of the media.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.manchesterjournal.com/stories/draft-court-rules-would-ban-non-media-video-photos,530892"">The Manchester Journal</a>, when the proposed rules went to the Vermont Supreme Court in January 2018, media was defined as &quot;any individual or organization engaging in news gathering or reporting to the public, including free-lance reporter, newspaper, radio or television station or network, news service, magazine, trade paper, in-house publication, professional journal, or other news reporting or news-gathering agency, and any individual employed by such an organization.&quot;</p><p>Retired state Supreme Court Justice John Dooley, who chaired the procedural rules committee, told the Journal that they worked to adopt a “pretty broad” definition to avoid improperly denying applications for media registration. The registration system also established an appeals process by which a denied applicant can seek an “expeditious review” by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Shawn Cunningham, a reporter for The Chester Telegraph, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he was reporting on a hearing at the Windsor Criminal Division court when he was pulled aside by one of the court officers. The officer told Cunningham that he couldn’t take pictures without being registered.</p><p>“Now, I had seen this up on the wall the previous time I had been to court, but it seemed as if they were talking about recording, video and audio recording. And they said no, it’s all,” Cunningham said.</p><p>Cunningham said he was directed to the court clerk to register, but because approval would take several days he was able to receive a one-day registration waiver. In a matter of days Cunningham received his media registration, which appears to authorize him to take photos and recordings in Vermont courts in perpetuity.</p><p>“We have several things right now that affect our area that are going through the courts, and that’s both Vermont-run state courts and federal courts,” Cunningham told the Tracker. “So, I’m basically checking all the rules to make sure that whatever I’m going into at this point, that I’m good to go in there and do what I need to do.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/vermont_seal.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>Above the entrance to the Vermont Supreme Court in Montpelier is the state&#x27;s coat of arms.

The next day, on Aug. 27, 2019, someone was waiting outside of Sullivan’s home to serve him the subpoena, according to his <a href=""https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/i-got-subpoenaed-in-the-craig-wright-ira-kleiman-6-billion-satoshi-nakamoto-case-and-im-not-giving-them-jack/"">article</a> outlining the events.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker reviewed the subpoena, which Sullivan posted with his article. It orders him to hand over any documents and communications between him and Wright since 2006 (before Bitcoin was invented), listing out more than 110 items that count as “documents,” including their encrypted WhatsApp and Signal messages, every social media conversation, interview notes and transcripts, drafts of his article and any relevant documents protected by computer encryption.</p><p>“I’m a journalist and the court has no right to any of my files, notes, thoughts or personal belongings. They are not getting anything from me,” Sullivan wrote.</p><p>Sullivan told the Tracker that he refused to attend the deposition hearing scheduled for Sept. 10. His lawyer filed a motion to quash on Sept. 9, arguing that the breadth of documents requested suggests that the subpoena is a fishing expedition with no clear idea how, if at all, the documents are relevant to the case.</p><p>The filing also included an affidavit from Sullivan authenticating his article and stating that it truly and accurately reflects his interview with Wright. In addition to asking that the subpoena be quashed, they are asking for Kleiman to cover Sullivan’s legal fees.</p><p>“I can fight this for years if I need to,” Sullivan told the Tracker. “What I really want is just to have my press freedom back.”</p><p>On Sept. 20, a judge granted Kleiman’s attorney a 21-day extension to respond to the motion to quash the subpoena against Sullivan. In a joint filling from Wright and Kleiman they state, “The parties have been engaged in extensive settlement negotiations and have reached a non-binding agreement in principle to settle this matter.”</p><p>If a settlement is reached, Sullivan told the Tracker, it is likely that the subpoena against him would be dropped.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTS2PVOK.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>The Bitcoin logo</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['PENDING'],None,None,None,None,None,None,Modern Consensus,,,,,,,
BuzzFeed reporter receives subpoena in ongoing Unsworth-Musk defamation lawsuit,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/buzzfeed-reporter-receives-subpoena-ongoing-unsworth-musk-defamation-lawsuit/,2019-10-01 18:55:36.546358+00:00,2020-03-02 17:50:28.615536+00:00,2020-03-02 17:50:28.499964+00:00,(2019-10-08 11:51:00+00:00) Judge quashes Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s deposition subpoena,Subpoena / Legal Order,,,,,Ryan Mac (BuzzFeed),2019-08-26,False,None,California (CA),"<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Ryan Mac, a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News, was issued his first subpoena in the unfolding case between caver Vernon Unsworth and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Aug. 26, 2019. Mac subsequently received a second deposition subpoena, bringing the <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/subpoena/?categories=6&amp;state=8&amp;targets=156%2C401"">total number of subpoenas issued against the outlet and its reporter to five</a>.</p><p>Unsworth is suing Musk for defamation, alleging that the tech executive repeatedly labeled him a pedophile without evidence on Twitter and in communications with Mac, the latter of which were published by the outlet.</p><p>Lawyers for Musk previously subpoenaed the outlet twice during the discovery phase, and lawyers for Unsworth did so once. BuzzFeed provided some of the requested documents while objecting to others on First Amendment and reporter’s privilege grounds. The judge sustained the outlet’s objections.</p><p>Musk was the first to file a subpoena demanding reporter Mac appear at a Sept. 11 deposition in San Francisco. About a week later, Unsworth’s counsel issued its own subpoena against Mac, effectively joining Musk’s. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker reviewed the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Pv8n-F-wD12n9GkaeS5rSX5_gkr9v1w/view"">motion to quash</a> both subpoenas for Mac’s deposition.</p><p>According to the filing, the cover letter on the subpoena stated, “Mr. Musk does not intend to seek testimony from you that would be protected by the United States or California Constitutions or any other reporter’s privilege.” The letter did not, however, state what information Musk did hope to obtain by questioning Mac.</p><p>Mac’s counsel argued that Musk’s attempt to depose the reporter was part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation.</p><p>“It is clear from Musk’s prior conduct that he would put Mac through the ordeal of a hostile deposition for no reason other than to retaliate against Mac for his critical reporting,” the filing said. “The deposition subpoenas must be quashed to avoid this oppressive outcome.”</p><p>The filing argued that Musk is trying to deflect blame for his comments about Unsworth onto Mac, claiming that because Musk wrote the phrase “off the record” in the unsolicited email he sent to Mac, he couldn’t reasonably foresee that the statements he made would be published and therefore cannot be held liable.</p><p>Mac’s attorneys argued that, as Mac never agreed to keep the emails off the record, their contents were fair game for publication.</p><p>According to the filing, Musk’s attorneys were asked to voluntarily withdraw the subpoena, but they declined to do so.</p><p>On Sept. 9, Michael Lifrak, an attorney representing Musk, emailed BuzzFeed Attorney Kate Bolger offering to withdraw the deposition subpoena if the outlet would agree to a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, in which one or more individuals from an entity are questioned about set topics. The topics proposed by Lifrak included BuzzFeed’s guidelines on publishing off-the-record and on-background information, pre-publication review process and editorial process and procedures for predicting article popularity.</p><p>Bolger responded over email, “This request calls for privileged matters related to BuzzFeed’s newsgathering materials and is, indeed, far broader than the request to Mr. Mac. It is not worth exploring.”</p><p>Mac’s attorneys filed a motion to quash both deposition subpoenas on Sept. 13, arguing that any information that could be gained legally is already available to the parties and everything else is protected under California’s reporter’s privilege.</p><p>A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 18.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/MacBuzzFeed4.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the first of two deposition subpoenas sent to BuzzFeed reporter Ryan Mac as part of a defamation suit between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and caver Vernon Unsworth.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

The memo stated the information was for use in “contemplated criminal and civil proceedings in England,” or possible future court cases.</p><p>The application was granted by a federal judge for the Southern District of New York on Aug. 9.</p><p>The subpoena, obtained by the Tracker, asked for all documents and communications relating to the forged police report, particularly any information that could be used to determine the identity of the forger and anyone who helped distribute the report. Fast Company largely complied with the subpoena, with lawyers for both parties exchanging emails in September and October.</p><p>Fast Company did not, however, provide information that would have identified Baram’s confidential source, stating that Baram claimed reporter’s privilege under New York’s shield law. Lucas Bento, an attorney for Pishevar, acknowledged in an email to Fast Company’s general counsel Alison Anthoine that such identifying information was the central aim of the subpoena.</p><p>“While we recognize the source’s name is not being redacted in any of the documents, can you please provide us further information about the individual who distributed the forged police report to Mr. Baram,” Bento wrote, “including his or her name or alias, contact information, Signal contact information (including screen name and number), or other identifying information (such as gender, race, age, height, weight, eye color, hair color, glasses, or dress).”</p><p>Bento also threatened to pursue a court-ordered deposition of Baram if Fast Company did not provide the identifying information voluntarily. In subsequent emails, Anthoine provided information about the individual whom the source said provided them the report, but not about the source.</p><p>Bento followed through on the threat to pursue testimony and documents from Baram, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/tech-investor-attempts-compel-us-journalist-identify-confidential-source/"">filing an application for additional discovery</a> on Oct. 31, 2019.

When Evers took office, News Director Bill Osmulski and his former colleague Matt Kittle asked to be added to the new list. According to the complaint, they received no response and were never added to the list of approximately 1,000 local, state and national reporters and outlets.</p><p>The complaint also details the barring of MacIver reporters from a press briefing on Feb. 28, 2019, to which 26 members of the Capitol press corps had been invited. Kittle and Osmulski attempted to RSVP and arrived at the designated time, but were not permitted to attend as they were not on the invitee list.</p><p>Suhr told the Tracker that on April 4 he sent a letter to Evers’ office stating that the administration had violated the News Service’s First Amendment Rights and asking for the reasoning behind excluding the outlet.</p><p>A few weeks later, the governor’s legal counsel responded that Evers’ communication’s office “invites some journalists to limited access events, such as exclusive interviews, on a case-by-case basis using neutral criteria, namely newspaper circulation, radio listenership, and TV viewership.”</p><p>The News Service subsequently filed a public records request, Suhr said, seeking any documentation outlining the “neutral criteria” used by Evers’ staff. According to the complaint, Evers’ staff denied the request based on attorney-client privilege.</p><p>The MacIver Institute then filed their lawsuit against Governor Evers in August, alleging he violated its staffers’ constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of the press and equal access. The Institute also motioned for a preliminary injunction from the court that would force Evers’ office to add the News Service to the media advisory list before a ruling is reached in the case.</p><p>In its write-up of the suit, The Associated Press <a href=""https://apnews.com/98c5eb27e33248e78e3f8b62e4eb072a"">reported</a> that governors from both parties have held similar briefings in the past, and that such briefings have typically been open only to certain invited reporters, not the entire press corps.</p><p>The AP also published a statement by Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, that Evers believes strongly in a “fair and unbiased press corps” and remains committed to openness and transparency.</p><p>In a brief in opposition to the injunction, Evers’ counsel argued that the existing media list is comprised of journalists and news organizations that “meet criteria which focus on whether the requestor is a bona fide press organization,” and that the MacIver News Service does not.</p><p>A memo dated June 26 from the governor’s Office of Legal Counsel was filed alongside the brief, outlining the criteria used to determine whether a journalist or outlet is “bona fide.” The factors listed are based on the standards used by the <a href=""http://presscredentials.legis.wisconsin.gov/"">Wisconsin Capitol Correspondents Board</a> and the <a href=""https://www.dailypress.senate.gov/?page_id=70"">US Congress</a>, and include in part:</p><ul><li>Is the petitioner employed by or affiliated with an organization whose principal business is news dissemination?</li><li>Is the petitioner a bona fide correspondent of repute in their profession, and do they and their employing organizations exhibit the following characteristics?</li><li>Both avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest;</li><li>Both resist pressures from advertisers, donors, or any other special interests to influence coverage;</li><li>Is the petitioner or its employing organization engaged in any lobbying, paid advocacy, advertising, publicity or promotion work for any individual, political party, corporation or organization?</li></ul><p>The brief asserts that the Governor’s office concluded that the MacIver News Service does not meet these criteria.</p><p>“The MacIver Institute is not principally a news organization. On its website, it characterizes itself as ‘a Wisconsin-based think tank that promotes free markets, individual freedom, personal responsibility and limited government,’” the brief reads. “The organization’s ‘news’ branch makes no effort to distinguish itself from the overall organization mission.”</p><p>In response to these claims, Suhr told the Tracker that the MacIver Institute is a 501(c)3 and therefore legally barred from engaging in political activity, and the Institute is not registered as a political lobbyist. Suhr asserted that news with a perspective has become commonplace in the new media environment, and doesn’t inherently delegitimize the reporting such outlets produce.</p><p>“When government sets up criteria for media, it’s easy to default to this old-school, traditional criteria, to impose requirements like ‘broadcast to a certain number of households,’ or to require that you be a print news outlet,” Shur said, referencing <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/nevada-judges-orders-online-journalist-reveal-sources-says-not-protected-shield-law/"">the case of Sam Toll</a> in Nevada. “To some extent what the governor’s office has done here is they defaulted to criteria that were designed for an old media age, and I think they did that to justify their decision after the fact to exclude my client.”</p><p>According to the complaint, if the governor’s office had adopted the criteria set by the state legislature, MacIver’s journalists would have qualified as they are already credentialed for the Capitol press corps.</p><p>“The new neutral criteria are no salvation: they were not developed openly, are not applied equally, do not permit an opportunity for journalists to show their bona fides, exclude legitimate news outlets besides MacIver, and violate the Constitution,” the complaint states.</p><p>The Governor’s office did not respond to the Tracker’s calls or emailed requests for comment.</p><p>First Amendment experts <a href=""https://apnews.com/98c5eb27e33248e78e3f8b62e4eb072a"">told the AP</a> that MacIver appears to have a strong case, drawing a parallel between MacIver’s exclusion and President Donald Trump’s attempt to bar CNN reporter <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/white-house-suspends-cnn-reporter-jim-acostas-press-credentials-and-falsely-accuses-him-manhandling-intern/"">Jim Acosta</a>. Neither the attempt to ban Acosta in 2018 nor the White House’s attempt to suspend correspondent<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/white-house-suspends-correspondents-press-pass-reporter-alleges-retaliation/"">Brian Karem</a> in 2019 were upheld.</p><p>Robert Dreschel, a media law expert and journalism professor at UW-Madison, said it appears Evers’ office had no standards or guidance in place when MacIver was denied access. “That’s very troublesome,” Dreschel said.</p><p>Shur told the Tracker that he and his clients are still awaiting a ruling on their motion for a preliminary injunction, and that a tentative trial date has been set for early 2021.</p><p>“This case isn’t just important to MacIver, it’s not just important to journalists: it’s important to all of us in America because we all have a stake in a healthy First Amendment and we all have an interest in ensuring an active, vigilant press corps that insists on the transparency and accountability we need from our government to make sure that our democracy functions.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTS24NPC_kEjP2dv.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>Tony Evers speaks at a rally on the eve of his 2018 election as governor of Wisconsin.

Kratovil was covering the event on behalf of a reporter who could not, he <a href=""https://twitter.com/Charlie4Change/status/1158360810248384512"">tweeted</a>, and planned to record the gala ceremonies and post the video to the outlet’s YouTube channel without any editing. Kratovil said he was there for the keynote speech, given by White House correspondent and CNN analyst April Ryan.</p><p>Kratovil told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that when he checked in and set up his camera at about 6:45 p.m., the public relations officials did not inform him that there would be any limitations or restrictions on filming the proceedings. Kratovil said that he was able to film the first hour and a half of the event without issue.</p><p>When Rep.

Police later determined that it was sent from Banda Treviño’s Facebook account.</p><p>Garcia-Peña said the message was in unclear Spanish, but roughly translated to “You need to shut your trap or this will be you.”</p><p>Brenda Lee, law enforcement liaison for the Starr County Attorney’s Office, <a href=""https://www.krgv.com/videos/arrest-warrant-issued-following-threat-to-valley-reporter/"">confirmed</a> to KRGV Channel 5 News that the message also said in part, “Be informed before moving, you sucker, because soon you will wake up like this. The world is small and I am everywhere.”</p><p>Attached to the message was a picture showing a severed head and a dismembered body, according to KRGV.</p><p>Garcia-Peña told the Tracker that she has received threats before, but this message had more substance and concerned her. She said she reached out to the local district attorney who advised her to contact the special crimes unit.</p><p>Law enforcement liaison Lee told KRGV that local police did not hesitate to take action. “We will not tolerate any news media or any news media outlet being threatened for doing their job,” Lee said.</p><p>Garcia-Peña said that police were able to identify Banda Treviño as the source of the message, but that they believe he left for Mexico sometime in 2018. Police have put out an active warrant for Banda Treviño’s arrest in addition to the indictment he is already facing.</p><p>Garcia-Peña said shortly after KRGV published about the threat she received, Banda Treviño responded with a long, vulgar comment on El Tejano’s Facebook page. Garcia-Peña told the Tracker that this comment did not have threats of violence, but claimed that some of the outlet’s reporting was incorrect.</p><p>The threat has strengthened her relationship with her readers, Garcia-Peña told the Tracker, and she plans to continue working as one of only two reporters covering local crime and politics.</p><p>“I think I’ve gotten more support from my community, more readers,” Garcia-Peña said. “And in terms of me reporting: It hasn’t made me quiet.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Garcia-Pena2.1.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>Texas weekly El Tejano on newsstands</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

And get that camera out of here.” Reeg can be seen moving past Sierra toward Everett, growing hostile as he attempts to swipe the camera away.

Starks, who is white, was <a href=""https://katv.com/news/local/little-rock-police-officer-fired-after-internal-investigation-of-deadly-shooting"">fired</a> from the force in May for fatally shooting Bradley Blackshire, a black man, during a February traffic stop. (In April, Pulaski County prosecutors <a href=""https://katv.com/news/local/little-rock-police-officer-wont-face-charges-in-deadly-shooting"">announced</a> that they would not charge Starks with a crime in Blackshire’s death.)</p><p>The new rule, which went into effect on July 24, 2019, gave the chairman of the Civil Service Commission discretion to bar all photography, video, and audio recording from the commission’s disciplinary appeal hearings. “The new language says the chairman ‘may’ allow broadcasting ‘provided that the participants will not be distracted, nor will the dignity of the proceedings be impaired,’” the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette <a href=""https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jul/24/rule-allows-taping-ban-at-civil-service/"">reported</a>.</p><p>Arkansas has robust Freedom of Information and open meetings laws, but the civil service commission was arguing that it could block recording from this meeting because it was an appeal and thus qualified as a judicial proceeding.</p><p>Robert Steinbuch, a law professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the co-author of the state&#x27;s Arkansas Freedom of Information Act textbook, disagreed with that interpretation of the civil service commission’s role in an <a href=""https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jul/25/panel-s-new-ban-on-recording-hearings-r/?page=1"">interview</a> with the Democrat-Gazette. Steinbuch told the newspaper that, although the commission performs some quasi-judicial roles, it is not actually a judiciary body.</p><p>“There’s not one, there’s a series of attorney general opinions that say it is well within the citizen&#x27;s right to record and videotape,&quot; Steinbuch told the newspaper. &quot;This is not new. This is well-established. If it&#x27;s not an executive session, if it&#x27;s otherwise an open meeting, a public meeting, then you can record.&quot;</p><p>On the morning of July 25, photographers and videographers were both ejected and barred from entering the hearing room at City Hall where the commission was meeting to consider Starks’ appeal. These included Rich Newman, a cameraman from KATV, Little Rock’s Sinclair-owned affiliate. Officers from the Little Rock Police Department also escorted two bloggers, Russ Racop of <a href=""https://badgovernmentinarkansas.blogspot.com/"">Bad Government In Arkansas</a> and Ean Bordeaux of <a href=""https://corruptionsucks.blogspot.com/"">Corruption Sucks</a>, out of the hearing room after they declined to stop recording, citing their rights under the state Freedom of Information law.</p><p>A reporter for the station, Marine Glisovic, <a href=""https://twitter.com/KATVMarine/status/1154380315751792640"">raised her objection</a> to the ban in the hearing. “As a media member for Channel Seven I’d like to make a statement on the record that this is in violation of the Freedom of Information Act,” Glisovic said. “I’d like to request that no business be conducted until our corporate attorney can challenge this in court.” Despite this objection, no recording was permitted in the room during the morning session.</p></div></div>

It also runs afoul of the Arkansas’ Freedom of Information Act, which guarantees citizens access to public meetings and public records,” the SPJ statement read.</p><p>After consulting with the station’s corporate legal team, KATV hired a local attorney to draft an injunction against the ban. “We let the city know that we planned to file that injunction in the early afternoon if they didn’t rescind that ruling and allow us to be in the hearing,” Nick Genty, KATV’s news director, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>But before KATV filed its injunction, City Attorney Tom Carpenter announced around 3 p.m. that the city had decided to set aside the new rule. &quot;We recommend at this juncture [that] the ban be withdrawn by the commission,&quot; Carpenter said, <a href=""https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jul/26/city-bans-then-oks-recording-20190726/?page=1"">according</a> to the Democrat-Gazette. The previously barred photographers and videographers quickly filed back into the room and began filming.</p><p>In an interview with the Tracker, Carpenter said while the rule was defensible under rules set out for trials by the Arkansas Supreme Court, it did not have the backing of city leadership. “Since the commission is appointed by the city, without the city’s approval it didn’t make sense to have the rule,” he said.</p><p>News Director Genty said he was glad the ban was lifted without KATV having to file the injunction. “We never want to be the story. We just want to cover the story, that’s all we were asking to do,” he said. “They were treating it as a court of law, but this wasn’t; this was a city civil service commission meeting.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Turn around!” Michela responds, “I have a right to be here, sir.” The man, holding his hand over the lens, responds, “Fuck you, no. No!”</p><p>The man approached Michela from the blindspot on his right created by the camera equipment, and was the first of several people to attempt to prevent Michela from filming. Michela told the Tracker that he was jostled enough to cause the camera to zoom erratically and the recording to stop and start multiple times.</p><p>Photos and video taken during the incident show a woman attempting to pull out the cord from the back of Michela’s camera and an arm reaching behind him to pull the camera off his shoulder.</p><p>At one point, Michela said, he felt “the camera being thrown from my shoulder towards the ground. I was able to catch it and prevent it from hitting the ground. It felt like people were pulling at me and at the camera.”</p><p>Larry Curtis, social media manager for KUTV, <a href=""https://kutv.com/news/local/kutv-photographer-assaulted-during-protest-of-inland-port"">wrote in an account</a> published by the outlet, that he “was also at the protest doing a live video on Facebook and rushed into the fray” when he saw Michela surrounded by protesters. In a photo taken by Harmon, Curtis can be seen inserting himself between Michela and some of the protesters.</p><p>Michela told the Tracker, “Larry came over and broke up the fight before it got too involved.” In the process, Curtis wrote in his account, his credentials were pulled off from around his neck and his shirt was ripped.</p><p>The incident left him shaken, Michela told the Tracker. “At the time I certainly felt threatened and I told the officers that I’d press charges if they ever found the guy,” Michela said. “Normally, to most people, my height is a deterrence. I’ve done this job 10 years and I’ve never had someone lay hands on me.”</p><p>During the same incident, Harmon also had to maneuver around protesters who were attempting to block him from documenting the scene, though he told the Tracker that he was not harmed and did not feel threatened.</p><p>According to the Tribune, <a href=""https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/07/11/protesters-involved/"">eight people were ultimately arrested</a> over the course of the protest.</p><p><i>Correction: An earlier version incorrectly identified Larry Curtis&#x27; title.</i></p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Ngo <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/independent-journalist-files-assault-charges-following-may-day-protests/"">told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> that he does not wear press identification or badges while covering protests, but openly films and identifies himself as media to those who ask. He also said that he has become well-known to the antifa community in Portland and has “come to expect” their hostility against him.</p><p>The far-right group The Proud Boys originally announced the Portland rally for June 29, almost exactly one year after the “Battle of Portland.” That event was marked with street fights and dueling protesters, and was ultimately classified as a riot by the Portland Police Department.</p><p>In planning an opposition rally, local antifa demonstrators called the Proud Boy rally an “attack,” and published a ”call to defend” the city. The post mentioned Ngo in a section labeled “Violent and Racist Proud Boy Propaganda,” and described him as a “local far-right Islamophobic journalist.”</p><p>The day before the rally, Ngo tweeted out screenshots from the post, writing, “I am nervous about tomorrow’s Portland antifa rally. They’re promising ‘physical confrontation’ &amp; have singled me out to be assaulted.”</p><p>Ngo and the public relations firm he has contracted to handle his media requests following the incident did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Guardian <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/30/portland-police-cement-milkshake-leftwing-rightwing-protests"">reported</a> that early on the day of the protest and counter-protests, Ngo was filming when protesters dumped a milkshake on him. Later video taken by Oregonian journalist Jim Ryan showed Ngo being hit and sprayed with silly string by masked individuals who appeared to be antifa demonstrators at around 1:30 p.m.</p></div></div>

The order also expanded restrictions of photography and recording to include steps and stairways, patios, hallways and sidewalks, which were not in the original order.</p><p>Supreme Court spokesman Aaron Nash told the AP that the photography ban was intended to reduce disruptions and protect the privacy and security of individuals attending the court, not hinder journalists’ ability to do their jobs. The policy appears to have been issued to unify appellate court policies.</p><p>Brutinel’s order received backlash from reporters and attorneys, the Arizona Republic <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/11/07/arizona-supreme-court-scales-back-crackdown-photos-video-near-courthouses/4156891002/"">reported</a>, who claimed the broad rule would hamper the media and the public’s access to newsworthy cases.</p><p>National Press Photographers Association lawyer Mickey Osterreicher told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, “It goes far beyond what their authority, I believe, should be. It’s one thing to control what goes on inside the courtroom, but not necessarily what goes on in what is traditionally a public forum outside.”</p><p>The court issued a <a href=""https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/22/admorder/Orders19/2019-142.pdf?ver=2019-11-06-150639-460"">narrower order</a> on Nov. 6, maintaining the restrictions of recording and livestreaming, but limiting the scope to within the appellate court buildings. The Republic reported that the revised order also removed wording allowing court officials to demand individuals delete photos or videos taken of them without their permission.</p><p>The order also revised stipulations from barring recording in outdoor areas to prohibiting “any activity that threatens any person, disrupts court operations, or compromises court security.”</p><p>Maria Polletta, state government and politics reporter for The Republic, told the Tracker that reporters on the beat were taken aback by the first order, and they’re waiting to see how the scaled back version is implemented.</p><p>“It’s obviously less sweeping than the first version,” Polletta said. “But as First Amendment attorneys have said, ‘disruptive’ is very subjective and it could still end up being applied to media while they’re just doing their jobs.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,<p></p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,Media,,,,,,,State Supreme Court

In an account published by the ACLU of Ohio titled, <a href=""https://www.acluohio.org/archives/blog-posts/photographs-and-the-first-amendment-my-harrowing-journey-through-u-s-customs"">“Photographs and the First Amendment. My Harrowing Journey Through U.S. Customs,”</a> Stegmaier wrote that the officers didn’t provide any explanation for why he was flagged.</p><p>While detained, the officers asked Stegmaier for permission to search his computer.</p><p>“It is possible that I could have avoided five months of psychological stress with three words: GET A WARRANT,” Stegmaier wrote. “But I was sleep-deprived, and innocent of any crime. So I let them.”</p><p>The officers took his phone and camera as well. Stegmaier wrote that he waited 4 ½ hours — causing him to miss his connecting flight to Cincinnati, Ohio — before an officer read him his Miranda rights. The officer proceeded to ask questions about why he was in the U.S., where he was planning on traveling next and whether he had had sex with children while abroad.</p><p>The questions presumably stemmed from photos Stegmaier had taken on his reporting trip. In <a href=""https://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-09-03-Stegmaier-Petition-Final-wo-Attachments_Redacted.pdf"">a petition in support of Stegmaier</a> dated Sept. 3, the ACLU of Ohio wrote, “In Manila, he captured numerous images of abject poverty and desperate conditions. He observed and photographed children swimming in filthy water and industrial waste, surrounded by heaps of plastic garbage and fecal matter.”</p><p>The ACLU went on to contextualize the photos: that the presence of unclothed children in public in the Philippines is “unremarkable” and images of such scenes routinely appear in journalistic and other publications.</p><p>When Stegmaier attempted to explain all of this to the CBP officers, he wrote, they were skeptical of his point-and-shoot camera and asserted that he should have “papers” showing that he is a “real” photographer. Stegmaier also wrote that the officers told him that he should consider himself lucky because the supervisory officer believed him enough not to arrest him.</p><p>At the end of his detention, Stegmaier wrote that the officers retained possession of his computer, camera and smartphone, along with the tens of thousands of photographs contained therein.</p><p>“It ruined my trip, as I was forced to halt the planned work that I was going to do in the U.S.,” Stegmaier told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “I also felt that the seizure damaged my credibility with a couple people that I was in the process of delivering work to. It was debilitating to not have access to my equipment.”</p><p>A month later, Stegmaier received an official Notice of Seizure notifying him that his equipment had been seized because it contained “visual depictions of sexual exploitation of children.”</p><p>In addition to the formal petition on Stegmaier’s behalf, a coalition of First Amendment organizations — including the National Press Photographers Association and National Coalition Against Censorship — wrote <a href=""https://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NCAC-Letter-USDHS-August-13-Final.pdf"">a letter to CBP urging the return of his equipment</a>.</p><p>“The possible disregard by DHS of federal and state level constitutional protections granted to Mr. Stegmaier strike at the heart of the most vital rights we strive to defend,” the letter reads. “The seizure of Stegmaier’s laptop, camera, and iPhone has caused untold damage to his professional life, forcing him to halt all of his work activities.”</p><p>Three months after his equipment was seized, Stegmaier wrote that CBP sent him a letter admitting that there was nothing illegal about his photos. The agency promised to return the equipment on the condition that Stegmaier sign a release waiving his right to sue for the wrongful detention and seizure, or else go through a formal hearing process that could take multiple months.</p><p>Stegmaier arranged to pick up his equipment in Detroit, during which CBP stopped him again and asked to search his belongings.</p><p>“Luckily, I carry the ACLU’s petition letter with me, right next to CBP’s letter admitting I did nothing wrong,” Stegmaier wrote. “I showed these letters to them, and eventually they let me go.”</p><p>He wrote that when he left Detroit, he took his equipment and his pictures with him.</p><p>“I don’t have a problem going to other countries to work,” Stegmaier told the Tracker. “I only have a problem returning home to a place where I am supposed to have civilian rights.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,<p></p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,"Detroit, Michigan",True,U.S. citizen,False,False,yes,None,None,yes,yes,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Susana Martinez in 2013 over five requests for records related to pardons, emails and the governor’s calendar under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.</p><p>The complaint, which was reviewed by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, alleged that the governor failed to release documents within the mandated time frame and either did not conduct a comprehensive search for or did not provide all responsive documents. The Reporter asked the court for injunctive relief in the form of new policies and procedures for handling IPRA requests.</p><p>The Reporter suit included a separate claim alleging that the administration denied the newspaper access to information provided to other outlets, violating the state constitution’s Free Press Provision.</p><p>“The press must be free to report on public affairs and officials’ conduct without reprisal,” the complaint reads. “A free press and public access to information are undermined if the access of members of the press to facts relating to public business is limited because they present a certain viewpoint or perspective that the Governor does not like.”</p><p>In December 2017, state District Judge Sarah Singleton ruled that, in regards to the denial of access, the governor had not violated the state constitution. Julie Ann Grimm, the Reporter’s editor and publisher, told the Tracker that Singleton’s ruling legitimized politicians giving outlets preferential treatment.</p><p>“The judge in her ruling and in some things that she said in court really made it clear that she felt like it was OK for public officials to pick and choose and to only talk to friendly press,” Grimm said.</p><p>Singleton did find that Martinez violated the state’s open records act three times in its tardy or non-existent responses to public records requests.</p><p>&quot;It is the Court&#x27;s opinion that if people create public documents on private email accounts, then when an IPRA request is made, the governmental body for whom those people are employed has an obligation to search or at least attempt to search those private accounts,” Singleton said, <a href=""https://www.sfreporter.com/news/2017/12/14/judge-gov-martinez-violated-public-records-law-not-constitution/"">according to the Reporter</a>.</p><p>“To hold otherwise would make it too easy to hide from inspection the very types of public records which are most in need of disclosure,&quot; Singleton said.</p><p>The Reporter was awarded attorneys’ fees totaling nearly $400,000 but no damages on the three counts. Grimm told the Tracker that no new IPRA policies or procedures were developed or implemented in response to the outlet’s request for an injunction.</p><p>Martinez’s attorney Paul Kennedy appealed the decision in 2018 on the grounds that the verdict was a split decision, <a href=""https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-pays-sf-reporter-legal-fees/article_9198b3b4-3989-11ea-a1ba-438b5bd24f28.html"">according to the Santa Fe New Mexican</a>.</p><p>In a compromise to avoid further litigation after Martinez left office, her successor, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, agreed to drop the appeal and pay a $360,000 settlement in June 2019.

Port Authority police officers responding to the protest then arrived and asked him to leave.</p><p>Nigro said that he was wearing two press badges around his neck — one from the National Press Photographers Association and one given to accredited journalists by the NYPD. He showed the badges to the officers and asserted his right to film the protest. After some back-and-forth discussion with the officers, he agreed to leave the area. Unexpectedly, the officers then arrested him for trespassing.</p><p>“While we were leaving, their radio went off and they were told to arrest me,” he said. “They apologized.”</p><p>Nigro was then taken to the Port Authority police station and handcuffed to a wall, and both his phone and camera were seized as evidence. He estimates that he was handcuffed to the wall for about two hours before Port Authority police officers escorted him to an interrogation room, where he was chained to a bench, read his Miranda rights, and questioned by detectives. Nigro said that he refused to answer any questions without his lawyer present. He was then fingerprinted and brought to a holding cell.</p><p>Nigro said that while he was detained in the holding cell, an officer from the NYPD’s media relations office — known as the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information, or DCPI — visited him in his cell to inform him that the NYPD was revoking his official press badge.</p><p>Nigro was eventually issued a desk appearance ticket and released, but his arresting officer refused to return his camera and phone.

Because Hood received a commutation, not a pardon, he was let out of jail early but the murder conviction stayed on his record.</p><p>At the time, a spokeswoman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez told CBS 2 Chicago that Alvarez was “deeply disappointed” with the governor’s decision to commute Hood’s sentence.</p><p>Just a month later, though, Alvarez’s office announced that its Conviction Integrity Unit had completed a two-year investigation into Hood’s case, which concluded that Hood’s conviction should be vacated. Alvarez then <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-tyrone-hood-conviction-dismissed-met-0210-20150209-story.html"">asked a court to vacate Hood’s conviction</a>, which the court did.

They argue that journalists like Schmidle were tricked into writing a false narrative, which in turn prompted Governor Quinn to commute Hood’s sentence and pressure the state attorney’s office to get Hood’s conviction thrown out.</p><p>On July 23, Schmidle’s attorneys <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/1/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C. to quash</a> the two deposition subpoenas, on the grounds that the subpoenas were improperly served, Schmidle’s testimony was unnecessary and Schmidle could not be forced to testify because he was a journalist.</p><p>The defendants’ attorneys defended their decision to subpoena Schmidle’s testimony, <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/7/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">filing a response to Schmidle’s motion to quash</a> that detailed their quasi-conspiratorial theory about Schmidle’s central role in getting Hood’s conviction tossed out.</p><p>“Defendants seek to take Schmidle’s deposition to explore his role in Hood’s coordinated</p><p>media campaign, because that campaign was critical to Hood convincing Gov.

Mehta found that, while the subpoenas had been properly served, the defendants had not shown that they had “exhausted every reasonable alternative source of information,” which they must do before forcing a journalist to testify. If the defendants wanted to learn about Schmidle’s communications with his sources, Mehta said, then they should subpoena those sources, rather than Schmidle.</p><p>Through a New Yorker spokeswoman, Schmidle declined to comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-08_at_1.12.59.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>A portion of the subpoena seeking testimony from reporter Nicholas Schmidle about a 2014 article published in The New Yorker</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Robert Neller, the commandant of the Marine Corps, since 2016 or 2017, but his requests have been repeatedly denied. When it was announced that Neller would be retiring in July 2019, LaPorta said he again filed interview requests pushing to have an exit interview.</p><p>“I keep asking, ‘Hey, can I get this exit interview?’” LaPorta told the Tracker, “And they’ve told me, ‘He doesn’t have availability right now’ or ‘He’s traveling’ or ‘Your request right now isn’t supportable.’”</p><p>LaPorta placed a final request to interview Neller on April 1, and followed up by email on April 3. LaPorta told the Tracker that he received no response from the Marine Corps.</p><p>When he sent another email on April 22, LaPorta said that he received a response three days later telling him that the general was “flooded with interview requests” and was unavailable, but they would keep his as a standing interview request.</p><p>However, LaPorta saw that <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/729300525/the-marines-top-general-talks-about-a-changing-corps"">NPR published an exclusive interview</a> with Neller on June 4. LaPorta told the Tracker he reached out to the NPR reporter to ask what he had written in his interview request and when he had filed it: the reporter told him April 24, nearly a month after LaPorta filed his request and one day before he was told Neller had no availability.</p><p>In an email shared with the Tracker, LaPorta asked Col. Riccoh Player, a public relations officer for Neller, why NPR’s request was granted while Newsweek’s was found “unsupportable.” In an emailed response, Player wrote, “Your request has been staffed, discussed, re-looked, risk-assessed and denied.”</p><p>Player’s response specifically mentioned <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/border-funding-general-trump-defense-1382113"">an article</a> published shortly after LaPorta’s interview request was filed, which cited two anonymous Pentagon sources. Player wrote to LaPorta that “this ‘un-named [sic] sources’ technique you incorporated was not helpful in making a case on your behalf.”</p><p>The email additionally cited his “Military ID Card Stunt” at Camp Lejeune, a major Marine Corps base in North Carolina. The “stunt” involved LaPorta using his military ID to access the base in February 2017 in order to speak with a source who said he did not trust the base’s public affairs office. Because LaPorta did not alert the office or receive its approval to conduct an interview, he was indefinitely barred from the base. This denial of access was <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/marine-corps-bans-journalist-camp-lejeune-base/"">documented by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a>.</p><p>Following Neller’s retirement in July, LaPorta told the Tracker he filed multiple interview requests to speak with the new commandant, but those requests have also been denied or ignored. LaPorta told the Tracker that on July 26 he received an email from Player denying his most recent request because “[The Marine Corps] leaders have a long memory.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTX30Z79_v6Yy0ML.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>Newsweek reporter James LaPorta was denied an interview request with Gen.

During the screening, Abaurrea was questioned about his work and an officer photographed his passport card.</p><p>Abaurrea, an American citizen, primarily covers sports, immigration and life on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. He told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that crossing the border has been a regular part of his life for years, and has been crossing at the same time and day—Friday morning at 9:15—for the past 10 weeks.</p><p>While he’s seen one or two officers, maybe with a dog, standing on the pedestrian crossing on the east side of the port of entry, he was surprised to see five CBP officials standing behind a blind corner.</p><p>“I’ve seen officers there before but never in that formation, never like that,” Abaurrea said.</p><p>As he rounded the corner and walked past the officers, they stopped and ordered him into “a little side cage area,” Abaurrea <a href=""https://twitter.com/NateAbaurrea/status/1132113040151760896"">tweeted that day</a>. He said that they directed him to be quiet, turn around and place his hands down on a metal table. Two of the officers emptied his pockets of all of his belongings, including his phone, but did not attempt to search his electronic devices.</p><p>Abaurrea asked the officers why he was being stopped. “What’s the probable cause here?” he quoted himself as saying <a href=""https://medium.com/@nateabaurrea/the-fourth-amendment-is-dying-8b7a9b76dc76"">in an account of the incident</a>.</p><p>“We don’t need probable cause, sir,” an officer responded. “We can stop and search whoever we want.”</p><p>Officers asked how much money Abaurrea was carrying, where he was going and why. When he told them he was on his way to a work meeting, they asked him what he did and, when he said he was a writer, who he worked for. An officer Abaurrea identified as “CBP Officer West” then aggressively patted him down, snapping the waistline of his underwear. He was then ordered to show them his passport card.</p><p>As West checked the legitimacy of his card and entered numbers into a machine, Abaurrea wrote, a young female officer told him, “If you just cooperate, this will be over. You need to familiarize yourself with the rules, sir.”</p><p>When Abaurrea again asked to be told why he was stopped, he wrote that West smiled and asked him to take off his shoes, which were also thoroughly searched. He was then told he was free to go, and began gathering up his belongings. Abaurrea reported that at the moment he noticed West still had his passport card, the officer pulled out a cell phone and took a picture of the card. Abaurrea asked why he did that, to which West responded it was “for [his] records.”</p><p>CBP was not immediately available for comment on whether the officer used a government or personal phone, why the photo was taken or where the image is now.</p><p>Abaurrea told the Tracker that he has been in contact with multiple nonprofits and organizations that are providing him advice and legal aid as he pursues next steps, including filing for a redress number, a FOIA on his name in CBP and Department of Homeland Security records and a possible lawsuit.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

In addition to the unredacted documents, the subpoena requested information on Choi’s reporting process, including any documents or evidence on how The Maroon obtained the documents and the identity of the author, if known. The deadline for response was June 3.</p><p>Peter Scheer, board president of the First Amendment Coalition, told CNN Business that the fact Choi is a student journalist “could complicate matters.”</p><p>“It could be up for debate whether a student journalist is granted the same protections as a journalist reporting as their full-time job,” Scheer said.</p><p>Matt Topic, a government transparency and media lawyer who is representing Choi pro-bono, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he is confident that the qualified privilege granted by Illinois’ Shield Law applies to Choi.</p><p>The statute <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/privilege-compendium/illinois/#a-shield-law-statute"">defines a reporter</a> as “any person regularly engaged in the business of collecting, writing or editing news for publication through a news medium on a full-time or part-time basis.”</p><p>Choi told the Tracker that he and Topic had filed a response to the subpoena and are continuing to fight it.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

She told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she pushed back, and asked for a citation of the legal authority that would allow the public to attend a meeting, but not the press.<br/><br/> “[The event] was originally set for those who had signed up as consulting parties to the process, but then members of the public insisted they be allowed in and I went in as well,” Lauer told the Tracker.<br/><br/> Pohakuloa Training Area Public Affairs Officer Mike Donnelly said that the event was not open to the public, and that some consulting parties and signatories to a training programmatic agreement that were present did not want the meeting recorded. However, he said that “to avoid conflict and to show good faith,” the meeting was opened to non-consulting attendees to fill open seats.</p><p>“Notably, only one journalist showed for the meeting in Hilo,” wrote Donnelly. “As a result, we did state that it was not open to the public, however, as a concession and out of respect for the journalist and 20+ years of working with media, I requested the reporter and our subject matter expert to move into a separate room where they could talk and have a Q &amp; A session so the reporter gathered content and context for her story.”<br/><br/>Lauer said that any time she spent with an official focused on gaining access to the meeting rather than on gathering information for reporting.<br/><br/> “If it were an interview for a story, I would have asked them about the details of the project, not about the meeting,” she said.</p><p>Lauer said that she left after being told by both Donnelly and a cultural resource manager for U.S. Army Garrison Pohakuloa that she could not remain.</p><p><a href=""https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/05/18/hawaii-news/army-boots-wht-from-public-meeting/"">West Hawaii Today reported that</a> an activist who attended the meeting said that attendance was initially to be limited to a list of consulting parties, but was later opened to the public altogether — before Lauer was told to leave.<br/></p><p>Lauer told the Tracker that on the Monday following the incident the Army commander called her to apologize and claimed he was not aware that his staff had taken the action to ban her from the event. She said that the commander was present at the meeting, near the front of the room.<br/><br/> “In retrospect, the PTA Team could have certainly done things differently, however, we were following the established process and respecting those who are consulting parties and signatories,” wrote Donnelly, the public affairs officer. “We will continue to engage the media in an open and transparent manner.”</p><p>Although Lauer was not able to attend the meeting, she said she was later given video footage by one of the attendees, which she said could aid future reporting.<br/></p><p>On May 19, <a href=""https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/05/19/opinion/our-view-military-wrong-to-boot-wht/"">West Hawaii Today published an opinion piece</a> arguing that the Army was wrong to boot its reporter from the event. It expressed concern about how extreme press freedom violations — such as those by President Trump — can seep into the conscious of everyday people.</p><p>“Some of it, like booting the media from a public gathering, we cannot write off as simply silly,” the piece reads. “Kicking a reporter out of a public meeting is a serious issue. It cannot become the norm. The United States military is a first-rate operation.

Over the course of four hours, the officers aggressively questioned him about his reporting and searched his electronic devices.</p><p>Harp, an Austin-based reporter, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he has traveled extensively for work, reporting from Mexico and as a war correspondent in the Middle East.</p><p>In an account of the incident <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/06/22/cbp-border-searches-journalists/"">he published in The Intercept</a>, Harp wrote that he is usually waved through immigration after a few questions. This time, the questions were more aggressive than usual, and after Harp told the officer that he had spent a week in Mexico on a reporting trip, the officer asked what the piece was about.<br/><br/> “[That] didn’t sit right with me,” Harp wrote. “I tried to skirt the question, but he came back to it, pointedly.”</p><p>Harp recalled saying something to the effect of not having a legal obligation to disclose the content of his reporting. Shortly after, a supervisor told him that if he refused to answer the question he would not be allowed into the United States. Customs and Border Protection officials also repeatedly denied Harp’s requests to contact a lawyer, stating that he wasn’t under arrest.</p><p>When CBP officers returned to ask again about the content of his reporting, Harp wrote that he gave a glib, joking response.</p><p>“From then on out, the officers made it clear that I was in for a long delay,” he wrote.</p><p>Though Harp ultimately told the officers that he was finishing a piece for Rolling Stone about men gunrunning from Texas and Arizona to the Mexican cartel, the officers searched his suitcase and carefully read his journal containing personal and professional notes.</p><p>The officers then asked Harp to unlock his electronic devices so they could be searched as well.</p><p>“When the officers told me they only wanted to check my devices for child pornography, links to terrorism, and so forth, I believed them,” Harp wrote in his account. “I was completely unprepared for the digital ransacking that came next.”</p><p>Harp told the Tracker that while wary of compromising his cell phone and laptop, he decided to unlock them after being denied access to a lawyer in order to prevent officers from confiscating his devices. Over the next three hours, the officers combed through his photos, videos, emails, business correspondence and internet history. They also examined his text messages, including encrypted messages on WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.</p><p>The officers frequently took his devices out of the room for long periods of time, and Harp told the Tracker that he suspects they may have made copies. They also wrote down his laptop’s serial number and three or four numbers and alphanumeric sequences found deep in his phone’s settings, including the phone’s IMEI number, a 15 digit identity code that can be used to track a phone’s physical location.</p><p>Over the subsequent hours, Harp wrote, the officers questioned him about all aspects of his work, his conversations with editors and colleagues and his political views.</p><p>“Interestingly,” Harp wrote, “they didn’t ask me anything about CBP itself. I had told them my current story was about gunrunning, but they didn’t think to ask if I’d done any reporting on their employer, which I had. In fact, my laptop contained hardwon documents on CBP.”</p><p>Harp told the Tracker that while he can’t be certain the officers didn’t review those documents, he didn’t see them reading the files and they didn’t ask him questions about them.</p><p>On three occasions during the course of his secondary screening, Harp wrote, an officer he identifies as Pomeroy “pronounced words to the effect that he was subjectively forming a reasonable belief that I might grab his service weapon.” Harp wrote that the “rhetorical move” and Pomeroy’s clapping his hand to his sidearm was an “implicit death threat.”</p><p>Four hours after he was pulled into secondary, an officer told him he was free to pack up his luggage and go.</p><p>Harp told the Tracker that the point of writing The Intercept article about his ordeal was to demonstrate the unchecked power that CBP has been accumulating. “CBP has gotten less reigned in and more aggressive, and with few checks on them they can do this to anybody for any reason.”</p><p>Harp wrote that when asked for comment on his article, CBP sent him a statement which read, in part, “CBP has adapted and adjusted our actions to align with current threat information, which is based on intelligence… As the threat landscape changes, so does CBP.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The code was designed to collect IP addresses and other information from his computer and network.</p><p>Prine has written extensively about the case of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who is accused of stabbing and killing a wounded 17-year-old ISIS militant and shooting two unarmed civilians during a 2017 deployment to Iraq.</p><p>The prosecutor, Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, also sent emails containing the code to 13 members of Gallagher’s defense team.</p><p>Gallagher’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the prosecutor for his actions on May 27. “This case has been hopelessly plagued by misconduct by prosecutors,” the filing stated, <a href=""https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/05/28/motion-filed-to-dismiss-lead-prosecutor-and-judge-in-seal-war-crime-trial/"">according</a> to the Navy Times. “This misconduct has taken many forms but has culminated in the inexcusable and unethical use of an email tracking beacon to monitor the emails of opposing counsel in direct contravention of multiple states’ ethics opinions, including CDR Czaplak’s licensing state of New York.”</p><p>In this filing, Gallagher’s defense counsel also argued that the judge in the case, Capt. Aaron Rugh, had met with Czaplak and an NCIS agent to discuss their desire to determine from where leaks in the case were originating.</p><p>At a hearing on that motion, “Navy law enforcement staff detailed how they created a plan to monitor emails sent to Chief Gallagher’s lawyers, while giving the judge in the case the false impression that the Navy had permission to do so from the Justice Department. No warrant or any other sort of permission was issued,” the New York Times <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/us/seal-war-crime-court-martial.html"">reported</a>.</p><p>On June 3, Rugh issued an order removing Czaplak as prosecutor in the case, according to the New York Times. That order is sealed.</p><p>Prine declined to comment further on the case.</p><p>Gabe Rottman, director of the Technology and Press Freedom Project at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that this was “one of several incidents in recent weeks that raise great concerns about press freedom.”</p><p>“It is certainly very concerning,” Rottman told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “There have been reports that the tool that was used here could have accessed the contents of emails.”</p><p>If the Justice Department were handling the case, Rottman said, approval from the attorney general would have to be procured before any such tracking code were deployed, and there would also have been a notice requirement to the reporter.</p><p>An NCIS spokesman, when asked about the email to Prine, <a href=""https://www.militarytimes.com/2019/05/17/secret-tracking-device-found-in-navy-email-to-navy-times-amid-leak-investigation-raises-legal-ethical-questions/"">told</a> the Military Times, “during the course of the leak investigation, NCIS used an audit capability that ensures the integrity of protected documents.

He said he allowed them in after being shown a search warrant signed by a state court judge. The SFPD officers then handcuffed him and searched his house with guns drawn.</p><p>Carmody was not formally arrested or charged with any crime, but he was detained for more than five hours. When he was finally released, the SFPD gave him a receipt showing that he had been in police custody from 8:22 a.m. to 1:55 p.m.</p><p>While Carmody was in SFPD custody, two FBI agents asked to interview him, but he refused and requested an attorney. An FBI spokeswoman later told the Times that the FBI agents were not involved in the search of Carmody’s house. Technically speaking, Carmody was only raided by the SFPD, not by federal agents.</p><p>During the raid on Carmody’s house, the SFPD learned that Carmody also used a separate office space for his independent media company, North Bay News, and quickly obtained a search warrant for the office space, <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/SF-police-raid-journalist-s-home-in-probe-over-13837363.php"">according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>.</p><p>In the end, the officers who searched Carmody’s house ended up seizing multiple notebooks, computers, phones, and cameras, while those who searched his office seized a USB thumb drive, multiple CDs, and a copy of a confidential police report into the death of San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi.</p><p>A source had leaked that police report to Carmody shortly after Adachi died unexpectedly on Feb. 22. The police report included salacious details about Adachi’s drug use and possible extramarital affair, and Carmody used the leaked report as the centerpiece of a story about Adachi’s death. Carmody sold his story on Adachi’s death to local TV news stations, who ran <a href=""https://abc7news.com/abc7-obtains-sfpd-report-on-jeff-adachi-death/5153863/"">segments about it</a>.</p><p>Progressive politicians roundly condemned the sensationalist coverage of Adachi’s death and accused the SFPD of deliberately leaking the police report to the media in order to smear Adachi, who had been a frequent critic of the police department. The SFPD also condemned the leak and pledged to track down the source of the police report.</p><p>According to the Chronicle, SFPD Captain William Braconi <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-police-get-an-earful-about-leaked-Adachi-from-13779379.php"">testified during a special hearing</a> in April that the police department had launched both an internal administrative probe and a criminal investigation into the leak.</p><p>A few weeks before the May 10 raid, two San Francisco police officers visited Carmody and asked him to identify the source who had leaked him a copy of the police report. Carmody refused. Carmody <a href=""https://californiaglobe.com/fr/journalist-says-police-feds-raid-home-in-pursuit-of-adachi-leak-information/"">told the California Globe</a> that when he refused, the officers warned him that if he did not identify his source, then he could be subject to a federal grand jury subpoena.</p><p>But Carmody never received a subpoena, either from a federal grand jury or a state prosecutor, which he could have contested in court. Instead, a state court judge secretly authorized the SFPD to raid his house and seize his devices.</p><p>David Stevenson, a spokesman for the SFPD, said that the raid on Carmody was part of the SFPD’s criminal investigation.</p><p>“The citizens and leaders of the City of San Francisco have demanded a complete and thorough investigation into this leak, and this action represents a step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of confidential police material,” he told the Times.</p><p>According to the Times, two judges of the San Francisco Superior Court — Gail Dekreon and Victor Hwang — approved the warrants to search Carmody’s house and office, respectively.</p><p>It is not clear who requested the warrants. A spokeswoman for the San Francisco district attorney’s office told the Times that the office was not involved in preparing the warrants.</p><p>Nor is it clear whether Dekreon and Hwang knew that Carmody was a journalist when they authorized the searches of his house and office space</p><p>Thomas Burke, an attorney at Davis Wright &amp; Tremaine who is representing Carmody, said that the raid violated Carmody’s First Amendment rights. He told the Times that the investigators should have issued a subpoena for the records they wanted from Carmody, rather than raiding his newsroom and seizing documents unrelated to the investigation.</p><p>“So much information has nothing to do with the purpose of their investigation,” he said. “If you are looking for one piece of information, that’s why you issue a subpoena.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Upon learning of the confidential settlement, the newspaper filed a court action seeking to unseal it.

Camera!” Ngo said that the antifa protesters were familiar with him and his work, as he has been covering antifa critically since November 2016.</p><p>While standing outside, Ngo said he was approached by a woman from the antifa side who said that she had applied for a job at his mother’s flower shop and a man who recited the shop’s address, which Ngo said felt like a pointed threat.</p><p>Patriot Prayer members arrived at the bar shortly after.</p><p>“[The two groups] were standing at the bar and across the street yelling at each other and eventually it did become physical,” Ngo said. “There was a brawl that involved what looked like pepper spray, mace and bear mace being sprayed, back-and-forth objects being thrown—glasses, bottles—and things were hitting cars and breaking on the ground.”</p><p>About 10 minutes after he arrived, Ngo said he noticed that the interaction was becoming very hostile and decided to move a bit further back.</p><p>“I stood behind a van that was on the street and peaked around the corner with my camera,” Ngo told the Tracker. “And then a masked individual ran from the property of the bar and sprayed the chemical directly in my face.”</p><p>In his video of the incident, a woman wearing sunglasses and a bandana covering her face can be seen coming from the opposite side of the van spraying what appears to be bear spray at members of Patriot Prayer before turning and spraying Ngo directly.</p><p>Ngo told the Tracker that the chemical burned his skin and eyes, and he had to be led across the street by a woman nearby to sit down. “I could still hear the fight and it sounded like it was getting closer and closer to me,” Ngo said. “The people around me said, ‘You’ve got to go, you’ve got to go now.’” Struggling to open his eyes, Ngo said he went to the nearest establishment, a wine bar, to use their restroom to wash what was left of the spray.</p><p>At approximately 8:20 p.m., he called the police non-emergency line to report the incident. Ngo said the operator informed him that all available officers were currently engaged in policing the riot, and that no one would be available to take his statement for several hours. Ngo returned home, and just after 11 p.m. an officer came by to take his statement.</p><p>This was not the only incident Ngo reported to the police that day: He told the Tracker that he was punched while he was covering a protest earlier on that day, which he reported to officers at the scene. Ngo told the Tracker that protesters had recognized him when he arrived at a publicly announced protest just after noon.</p><p>“Immediately, they were hostile to me, although I’ve come to expect that,” Ngo said. “The ones that knew me flipped me off and cursed at me. The ones who didn’t know me went up to me and said, ‘I don’t give you permission to record me.’ I didn’t respond to that: it was in a public park.”</p><p>At approximately 2:20 p.m. a man with his face covered and wearing sunglasses approached Ngo and sprayed his camera with silly string. An Oregonian reporter stepped between them, admonishing the man and prevented him from spraying Ngo or his gear further.</p><p>It was shortly after, as the protesters’ march stopped in front of Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices at around 2:45 p.m., that Ngo says an antifa protester punched him in the stomach.</p><p>In an email, a Portland Police Bureau public information officer said that the investigations into the two assaults reported by Ngo are ongoing and therefore the bureau cannot provide comment or details.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> <i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Independent journalist Justine Barron sued the judge that signed the order and Baltimore’s chief court reporter in response on May 2, alleging that it violates state law protections of public courtroom access.</p><p>Barron has covered <a href=""https://jewishjournal.com/blogs/n_the_case/236270/impossible-story-investigation-shooting-death-baltimore-police-detective-sean-suiter-part-1-commissioner-story/"">numerous stories</a> involving the city’s police department. She sought access to court audio recordings on April 17 as part of a case she is investigating. </p><p>Barron told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the circuit court was getting ready to fulfill her request, and told her she needed a check or money order. On April 23, Court Technologist Christopher Metcalf sent an email to Barron that she could pick up the record the next day.  <br/></p><p>The next day, Barron was abruptly informed that the court would restrict “access of court audio to parties from now on.” Now, she said, she’ll have to return the money order she obtained to the post office and hope it will be refunded.</p><p>Barron noted that in Maryland, only parties to the case can obtain courtroom video, but anyone can obtain audio or transcripts. </p><p>“I kept being told that I’d have to view it in the office,” she said. “But I was wondering if he [Metcalf] was confused, because I wasn’t looking to view anything. And then it was clarified that they aren’t letting anyone get audio recordings, but didn’t say anything about an order at first.”</p><p>Metcalf’s supervisor, Trish Trikeriotis, wrote to Barron on April 25 that the court had ordered that only parties or counsel representing a party were permitted to receive copies of recordings, although Barron could review the proceedings on site.</p><p>On April 29, Barron was sent a copy of a one-sentence order — dated April 24, the day she had originally been told she would be able to pick up the record — signed by Judge W. Michel Pierson:</p><p>“Pursuant to the terms of Maryland Rule 16-504(h)(1)(C), it is, this day of April 24, 2019, ORDERED, that no copies of audio recordings maintained by the Office of the Court Reporter shall be made available to persons other than parties to the relevant proceeding or counsel to the relevant proceeding.”</p><p>Although courts in Maryland have historically granted the public access to audio recordings, broadcasting these recordings is prohibited. Several podcast producers have <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/05/03/baltimore-court-audio-recordings-keith-davis-jr/"">done so anyway</a>, and a local journalist that Barron has worked with in the past has <a href=""https://www.law.georgetown.edu/icap/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2019/04/2019.04.09-Letter-to-Baltimore-City-Circuit-Court.pdf"">challenged the legality</a> of prohibiting broadcasting the recordings. </p><p>A litigator with the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/05/03/baltimore-court-audio-recordings-keith-davis-jr/"">told The Intercept</a> that denial of access to these audio recordings was “trying to replace one unlawful policy with another.” </p><p>Barron said that although the order initially appeared to target her specifically, it has affected other Baltimore reporters.</p><p>“After I was denied, at least one other person was able to get his CD,” she said. “The next day, someone was able to get one. So it seemed to be about me at first, but now, they’re punishing everyone.” </p><p>Paul McGrew, a Fox45 investigative reporter in Baltimore, wrote on social media that he was also denied access to courtroom audio recordings under the new order.</p></div></div>

 alleges that Judge Pierson’s order violates Maryland state law, which 
makes audio recordings of all trial court proceedings open to the 
public. </p><p>“...[A]
 local administrative order cannot override a State Rule,” it states. 
“Moreover, the ‘order’ that the Court Reporter’s office cited remains 
shrouded in mystery: the Court has not identified its reasons or 
authority for issuing the ‘order,’ nor has it posted the order publicly.
 These events paint a disturbing picture—that of local court officials 
seeking to stymie the State’s goal of shining a light on the judiciary 
and, worse yet, seeking to do so in the dark.”</p><p>Terri
 Charles, Assistant Public Information Officer for the Government 
Relations and Public Affairs Division of the Maryland Judiciary, 
provided the Tracker with a statement:</p><p>“The
 Judiciary does not comment on pending litigation. The media and the 
public can still listen to the court proceedings at the courthouse. The 
order states that copies are no longer available.”</p><p>Barron
 told the Tracker that courtroom recordings are critical in shedding 
important context on a case so that the press and lawyers can better 
understand what happened — which a transcript of the audio could not 
provide.</p><p>“Transcripts
 are not always accurate,” she said. “They are often full of typos. And a
 transcript is a document that the court has decided we can see — so we 
have to trust that they haven’t made a decision to edit it in some way. 
And the nuance of what happens in courtrooms is very important — like if
 someone stalls before answering or laughs, these details are 
important.” <br/></p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The charge was unsealed just hours after Ecuador terminated Assange’s political asylum and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/11/julian-assange-arrested-at-ecuadorian-embassy-wikileaks"">British police arrested Assange</a> inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.</p><p>The indictment — originally filed under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia on March 6, 2018 — focuses on Assange’s communications with Manning in 2010, when she was an Army intelligence analyst looking to leak classified documents to WikiLeaks.</p><p><a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5816961-Assange-Indictment.html"">According to the indictment</a>, between January 2010 and May 2010, Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of internal government documents — including significant activity reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, diplomatic cables, and Guantanamo Bay detainee reports — and leaked them for publication on WikiLeaks.</p><p>The indictment alleges that in March 2010, after Manning had already leaked large caches of documents to Assange, she asked Assange to help her cover her tracks in order to avoid being detected as WikiLeaks’ source. Specifically, she wanted help breaking a hashed password so that she could use a different user account to access the government databases from which she was downloading documents. The indictment alleges that Assange agreed to help Manning decrypt the password, though it does not mention whether he actually did so.</p><p>Assange is being charged with one count of conspiracy to violate provisions of the <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030"">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>, a broad anti-hacking law that prohibits unauthorized access to computer systems. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison.</p><p>The indictment specifically alleges that Assange entered into a conspiracy with Manning to “facilitate Manning’s acquisition and transmission of classified information related to the national defense of the United States so that WikiLeaks could publicly disseminate the information on its website.” It alleges that Assange tried to further this conspiracy by agreeing to try and crack the password for Manning.</p><p>The indictment also lists different “ways, manners, and means” that Assange and Manning allegedly used to carry out the conspiracy, some of which are typical of interactions between sources and reporters:</p></div></div>

Finnesand wrote in an email to Moreno that the administrator&#x27;s child “will not be featured in the year book with the Pride Club” and ordered her to contact the parent of every student featured “about their child’s quote and the context of the club.” Finnesand did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p></p><p>Moreno drafted a permission slip for parents to sign and let the adviser of the Pride Club know about it. The adviser protested, saying that no other clubs faced such a requirement, so it could be construed as discriminatory. When the adviser brought it up directly with Finnesand, the principal told Moreno she was being “insubordinate” by broaching the topic with the Pride Club adviser.</p><p>On Dec. 5, a yearbook student sent a private message on social media, writing that the principal wanted to change the publication layout for several groups, and have the parents of all Pride Club members sign a permission slip. The student lamented that “[a]ll the work we’ve done to build these clubs, all the memories, all the growth, will all be excluded from the yearbook if we don’t use our voice now in whatever ways possible.” Another student reposted the message, and Moreno brought the message to Finnesand’s attention, who viewed it as a “personal attack,” according to Moreno’s documentation.</p><p></p><p>The next afternoon, Finnesand came into Moreno’s classroom and confronted her within earshot of her students. “She said I’m not doing my job, and that I clearly can’t control my kids. And I ‘let’ them go to social media to slander her. And because of that I don’t need to be the yearbook adviser here,” Moreno wrote.</p><p></p><p>A meeting between Finnesand and Moreno’s journalism students took place on Dec. 7, where they agreed on a plan on how to cover non-curriculum clubs in the yearbook going forward.</p><p></p><p>After the students left that meeting, Finnesand spoke with Moreno again where she expressed that she never has problems dealing with leaders of other organizations. Moreno, in her document, wrote her interactions with Finnesand left her feeling belittled: “[d]ue to the nature of student publications, there will be times she needs to have a conversation with the adviser and with the editors. Every single time I have contacted her with a question or an update, I am met with animosity, condescension, and judgement. This is an unfair comparison, as issues regarding censorship do not arise from service organizations or athletics.”</p><p></p><p>The print edition of the school’s newspaper, The Torch, has always operated under prior review. Moreno’s students dropped off a proof of the December issue for review by Finnesand on Dec. 3, and it was returned to Moreno without any comments. The issue’s cover included an edited image of a girl surrounded by a cloud of smoke, accompanying an article about vaping titled “A Fatal Fad.” The photograph was taken using dry ice. The cover was included in the approved proof binder, but after the issue was distributed, Moreno was given a performance review memorandum to sign for the image appearing on the cover.</p><p></p><p>Following a series of interactions with Finnesand, Moreno sent a grievance letter to Jeff Stocks, assistant superintendent of the Katy ISD, in which she outlined the communication difficulties she was having with Finnesand. At a meeting with Stocks and Finnesand on Jan. 8, 2019, Moreno was giving a document that stated that “campus administration will approve all pages of the SLHS yearbook,” a departure from the previous policy that did not require prior review. At the conclusion of that meeting, Finnesand informed Moreno that she would not be the yearbook or newspaper sponsor next school year, according to Moreno’s account.</p><p>According to Moreno’s account, after a series of meetings with a school district Human Resources representative where the future of Moreno’s teaching contract was called into question, she opted to resign on April 1.</p><p>Moreno will teach through the end of the school year, and in her resignation cited her intention to find a teaching position in another school district, Ingram Dean at the SPLC told the Tracker.</p><p></p><p>Justin Graham, the general counsel for Katy ISD, told the Tracker in an email that Moreno resigned “unilaterally and voluntarily” from her job at Seven Lakes.<br/></p><p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Jeff Stocks as superintendent of Katy Independent School District.

Quaintance said she was blocking this evidence from being seen by anyone aside from the jury and attorneys in the case because “there’s privacy interest involved,”<a href=""http://www.startribune.com/attorneys-judge-to-address-final-details-in-upcoming-noor-trial/507825992/""> according</a> to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. She called airing this evidence publicly “inflammatory, potentially” as it “shows the deceased in extremely compromising situations.”</p><p>Noor is accused of fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an Australian woman who had called police to alert them to a possible assault taking place in the alleyway behind her home. Noor allegedly shot and killed her when she approached his police cruiser. Jury selection in the case began on April 1.</p><p>A coalition of media representatives including the Minneapolis Star-Tribune and Minnesota Public Radio filed a<a href=""http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-18-6859/NoticeofMotionandMotion040219.pdf""> motion</a> on April 2 objecting to Quaintance’s ruling barring media from viewing evidence, arguing it amounts to a unconstitutional “de facto closure of the courtroom.”</p><p>“Excluding the press and public from viewing evidence presented to the jury and other trial participants violates the Constitutional and common law rights of press and public access to criminal proceedings,” wrote Leita Walker, an attorney for the media coalition, in a<a href=""http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-18-6859/MemoranduminSupportofMotion040219.pdf""> memorandum</a> supporting the motion.</p><p>As of publication, the motion had not been scheduled for a hearing. Jury selection in the case is ongoing.</p><p>Courts have upheld the notion that media outlets and the public have a right to “contemporaneous access” to evidence during a trial, Walker argued, citing the Second Circuit case ABC v. Stewart, where the court found “[t]he ability to see and to hear a proceeding as it unfolds is a vital component of the First Amendment right of access—not . . . an incremental benefit.” Additionally, Quaintance’s argument is invalid, Walker wrote, as the state of Minnesota “does not recognize a posthumous right to privacy.”</p><p>The judge’s decision to limit access to evidence “clearly crossed a constitutional boundary,” Mark Anfinson, an attorney for the Minnesota Newspaper Association, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>In an<a href=""http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-18-6859/OrderonConductatTrial032719.pdf""> order</a> issued on March 27, Quaintance wrote that to preserve “order and decorum” in the courtroom, space devoted to the media will be limited to eight seats, of which four will be available to local media outlets and four to national and international outlets. Four seats each will be reserved for the family members of the victim and defendant, one for a sketch artists, which leaves only 11 seats for the public,<a href=""http://www.mnspj.org/2019/03/29/mnspj-opposes-hennepin-county-courts-severe-restrictions-on-noor-shooting-trial-coverage/""> according</a> to Joe Spear, the president of the Minnesota Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.

In response, Judges Bernhardson and Quaintance on April 1 added seven more media seats to the existing courtroom, <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/after-backlash-seven-new-seats-added-for-media-at-noor-trial/507977122/"">according</a> to the Star Tribune.</p><p>Quaintance’s order also banned all electronic or recording devices, including cell phones, tablets, and laptops, from the entire floor of the courthouse where the trial was taking place.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Ravalo later lodged a complaint with the California State Athletic Commission asserting that the kiss was without her consent and unwelcome. Ravalo also said Pulev sexually harassed her a second time, moments after the interview.</p><p>“I was immediately shocked and embarrassed, and didn’t know how to respond,” Ravalo said while reading from a prepared statement at a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gloriaallred/videos/10157199305955879/"">press conference</a> following the incident. “Next, I walked to the table to put my items in my backpack.

The newspaper sued after the mayor and borough council sent an official policy letter withdrawing advertising dollars from the Press &amp; Journal in retaliation for the paper’s reporting and editorializing.</p><p>Joseph Sukle, publisher and vice president of the Press &amp; Journal, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that there had been contentions with the borough over the last year or so.</p><p>“I guess they didn’t like what we were reporting or the editorial viewpoints that we expressed, and then they just cut off all communications and not talking to us or our reporters, not commenting,” Sukle said.</p><p>Sukle said he noticed that the borough stopped publishing public notices in the newspaper in June 2018. When he reached out to the borough to see if there was a problem, he was told he would shortly receive an official communication.</p><p>Mayor James Curry III and six out of seven of the Middletown Borough Council members sent Sukle a <a href=""http://cdn4.creativecirclemedia.com/pressandjournal/original/20190326-161915-Ltr_MtownBC_7_17_2018.jpg"">signed policy letter</a> the next month. The letter claimed that the newspaper’s reporting and editorials had been “detrimental to the efforts and initiatives of the Borough” and that it has contained “disheartening and demoralizing instances of distasteful sensationalism, misrepresentation of information and statements, unfounded speculation, questionable sourcing and observable bias.”</p><p>The letter ended: “Should the Press and Journal demonstrate reliability to professionally and responsibly report on the actions and statements of Borough Council and Management, as well [sic] critiquing us from a founded and balanced position, we will be happy to patron your newspaper again.”</p><p>In an <a href=""http://pressandjournal.com/stories/we-are-not-the-enemy-editorial,55807"">editorial following the settlement</a>, the Press &amp; Journal wrote that the letter took no pains to hide the meaning of the advertising ban: “In short, the letter was evidence of an unapologetic retaliation aimed at speech protected by the First Amendment.”</p><p>In an effort to resolve the issue out of court, Aaron Martin, the newspaper’s attorney, appeared at a Sept. 18 borough council meeting to read a <a href=""http://www.pressandjournal.com/stories/press-journal-lawyers-letter-to-council-we-implore-you-to-correct-the-unconstitutional,41133?"">letter</a> requesting a retraction of the policy letter. It argued that the council’s withdrawal of the borough’s advertising after a decades-long business relationship was a First Amendment violation.</p><p>“This attempted punishment of a member of the free press—requiring a kind of probationary penitence prior to restoration—is a naked attempt to coerce favorable press coverage,” the letter <a href=""http://www.pressandjournal.com/stories/press-journal-lawyers-letter-to-council-we-implore-you-to-correct-the-unconstitutional,41133?"">reads</a>.</p><p>The Press &amp; Journal provided copies of the letter to each council member and Mayor Curry.</p><p>“While our attorney was standing there, and just about the time he was finished reading it,” Sukle said, “the mayor actually takes the letter, takes it in his hands, rips it apart, and tosses it on the desk in full view of everybody: fellow councilors, our attorney. It was just an incredible action by an elected official.”</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>The paper asked that the council respond within seven days to its request in an effort to resolve the dispute out of court. Sukle told the Tracker that, in the end, they waited more than two weeks.</p><p>On Oct. 23, 2018, the law firm of Mette, Evans &amp; Woodside filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the borough on the newspaper’s behalf, asserting violations of the Press &amp; Journal’s rights to free speech and free press under the First Amendment.</p><p>Within days, Council President Angela Lloyd <a href=""https://middletownborough.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018.10.26-Press-Release.pdf"">issued a press release</a> stating, “The global services offered by the Press and Journal do not meet the Borough’s needs.” She also charged that the suit had “no merit in fact or law.”</p><p>On Nov. 14, the borough <a href=""https://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/pamdce/1:2018cv02064/118460"">attempted</a> to have the suit dismissed. However, U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Conner ruled against the borough and denied its request for dismissal on Dec. 13, stating that while no formal contract existed between the borough and the Press &amp; Journal, the borough had placed more than 200 notices over the previous 10 years, establishing a reasonable expectation of future business.</p><p>Though government bodies are required to publish certain public notices in publications available to the populations they serve, there are no federally mandated guidelines. In order to not violate the first amendment rights of publications, government entities cannot take into account the content or viewpoint of the news service as a criteria for placing public notices.</p><p>“Judge Conner’s decision will likely provide support to other media outlets facing retaliatory action by government for their reporting and editorializing,” Martin, the newspaper’s attorney, said in the Press &amp; Journal’s editorial.</p><p>Under the terms of the settlement reached in March, the borough is required to spell out its criteria for placing advertisements on bases that are “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral consistent with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.” Of the six council members who signed the official letter to the Press &amp; Journal, five remain on the council that established these criteria through a resolution.</p><p>Sukle, however, told the Tracker that the criteria are written in a way that excludes the Press &amp; Journal because it is a weekly publication. Further, Sukle said, the mayor has continued to restrict the newspaper’s access, most significantly to the police department.</p><p>“It’s gone so far that our staff—almost all of our staff—is blocked from the mayor’s Facebook pages, so we can’t access those,” Sukle said.</p><p>The newspaper did not ask for damages in the suit, though the settlement did require that Middletown Borough pay $22,000 to the Press &amp; Journal’s law firm for legal costs.</p><p>In the editorial discussing the settlement, the Press &amp; Journal wrote that it is undeterred by the borough council and mayor’s attempts to sway the newspapers reporting or editorializing: “We are not the borough council’s enemy. And we are not its PR firm.” </p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The department also took the unusual step of refusing to release a full transcript or a list of attendees.</p><p>The phone briefing was to discuss “international religious freedom” ahead of the secretary’s five-day trip to Beirut, Jerusalem, and Kuwait City. CNN <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/politics/state-department-faith-outlets-briefing/index.html"">reported</a> that one member of the department’s press corps was invited, but was un-invited after RSVPing. CNN also attempted to RSVP to the call, but received no reply from the department.</p><p>Despite repeated inquiries and complaints from members of the press corps, The State Department announced that it would not provide a transcript of the call, a list of the faith-based media outlets allowed to participate, the criteria used to determine which outlets would be invited nor answer if the media outlets invited included a range of faiths.</p><p>Religion News Service reported that it was invited to participate in the call, though it stated that the publication “is not a faith-based media organization, but rather a secular news service that covers religion, spirituality and ethics.”</p><p>RNS also included a list of publications that asked questions during the briefing call: the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Algemeiner (which covers Jewish and Israel news), World Magazine (which publicizes its content as “reporting the news from a Christian worldview”), America Magazine (“the Jesuit perspective on news, faith and culture”) and The Leaven, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. CNN reported that a reporter with EWTN Global Catholic Television said the outlet was not originally invited but asked permission to participate.</p><p>In a statement sent to CNN, a State Department spokesperson said that while some press engagements, including department press briefings, teleconferences, briefings and sprays are open to any interested domestic or international press, that is not always the case. “Other engagements are more targeted or designed for topic, region, or audience-specific media. This has always been the case,” they said.</p><p>Former State Department spokesperson John Kirby, now a global affairs analyst for CNN, told the outlet that he has “certainly seen times when particular journalists or columnists have been targeted for inclusion on given topics.” However, “to exclude beat reporters from something as universally relevant as religious freedom in the Middle East strikes me as not only self-defeating but incredibly small-minded.”</p><p>Kirby also tweeted in response to news that no transcript of the briefing would be released. “This is absolutely not OK. Cabinet officials are public servants. They work for us. When they speak to reporters on the record everything they say—in its entirety—needs to be released at the earliest appropriate time,” he wrote.</p></div></div>

On March 7, after the reporter tried to attend a hearing in the case, the hearing was closed to the public and press.</p><p>Bruce Boyer — a Loyola University law professor whose legal clinic represents the foster children in the case — then requested that the court issue an order prohibiting news outlets from publishing details about the case. On March 14, Patricia Martin, the presiding judge of the juvenile court’s child protection division, granted the request and issued a prior restraint order.</p><p>Documents related to the juvenile court case, including Martin’s prior restraint order, have not been made public. But on March 19, ProPublica Illinois <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/cook-county-judge-blocks-propublica-illinois-from-publishing-details-of-child-welfare-case"">reported on the existence of the prior restraint order</a>, describing it as an order “forbidding news organizations from publishing the names, addresses or any demographic information that would identify the children or the foster parents in a case ProPublica Illinois has been investigating.”</p><p>ProPublica Illinois was not initially a party to the case, but it asked the court to intervene in order to oppose the prior restraint order. On March 19, the court granted ProPublica Illinois’ motion to intervene, and on March 22, the news organization filed its opposition to the prior restraint order. A court hearing on the prior restraint order is now scheduled for April 5.</p><p>Prior restraint orders are relatively unusual and should not be confused with sealing orders, which are far more commonly employed by courts. A sealing order is used when a court needs to allow attorneys and parties to a case access to sensitive information; the sealing order just prohibits the attorneys and parties from turning around and disclosing that information to the public. A prior restraint order is much more serious, since it prohibits a third party with no connection to the case (often a news organization) from publishing information that they learned on their own.</p><p>ProPublica Illinois is opposing Martin’s prior restraint order because it sees it as an unconstitutional attempt by the government to interfere in its editorial process.</p><p>“The Supreme Court has made it very clear that courts are not supposed to be editors,” ProPublica President Richard Tofel told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “One of the Constitution’s guarantees is that editors should be editors.”</p><p>Tofel is correct that legal precedent is on ProPublica Illinois’ side. In 1971, the Supreme Court famously ruled that the government’s attempts to prevent The New York Times and the Washington Post from publishing a classified history of the Vietnam War <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/713/"">violated the news organizations’ First Amendment rights</a>. This “Pentagon Papers” case established the precedent that, except in extreme circumstances, prior restraints on the press are unconstitutional.</p><p><i>The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Toll was sued for defamation in December 2017 by Lance Gilman, a Storey County commissioner and owner of the Mustang Ranch, a legal brothel. In five stories, published between April and December 2017, Toll published claims that Gilman lives outside of Storey County, meaning he fails to meet the residency requirement to hold county office under Nevada law. The defamation suit demands Toll produces the sources of any information he procured before August 2017.</p><p>Nevada&#x27;s shield law—considered to be one of the most robust in the nation—states that &quot;[n]o reporter, former reporter or editorial employee of any newspaper, periodical or press association ... may be required to disclose the source of any information procured or obtained by such person, in any legal proceedings, trial or investigation.&quot; But because this law was passed in 1969, some 14 years before the inception of the internet, it does not explicitly extend this protection to reporters for online publications.</p><p>In what has been criticized as an unduly narrow reading of the law, Judge James Wilson found that &quot;[b]ecause Toll was not a reporter for a newspaper or press association before August of 2017 he was not covered by the news media privilege before August 2017, and therefore, the motion to compel must be granted as to any source of information obtained or procured by Toll before August of 2017.&quot;</p><p>Wilson ruled that because the Storey Teller is an online-only publication, it &quot;is not a newspaper and, therefore the news media privilege is not available to Toll under the &#x27;reporter of a newspaper&#x27; provision of [Nevada&#x27;s shield law].&quot;</p><p>In at least two other instances, Nevada courts have ruled that web-only publications were covered by the shield law, <a href=""https://www.rgj.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/07/nevada-judge-rules-online-sites-not-protected-media-shield-law/3098026002/"">according</a> to the Reno Gazette Journal. “My understanding is that it’s the first ruling of its kind and actually conflicts with other rulings,” Richard Karpel, executive director of the Nevada Press Association, told the newspaper.</p><p>Toll&#x27;s lawyers filed a petition for writ of prohibition with the state Supreme Court on March 18. &quot;While we respect Judge Wilson, we fundamentally disagree that an online journalist should be compelled to reveal their sources because they publish news articles in an online newspaper instead of traditional print newspaper,&quot; Luke Busby, one of Toll&#x27;s attorneys, wrote in a statement. &quot;Such a ruling undermines the protection of fundamental Constitutional principles of freedom of speech and of the press and stifles the free flow of information that is essential for any free society to exist.&quot;</p><p>On March 22, the Supreme Court stayed Gilman’s discovery request, pending review of Toll’s writ of prohibition. A deposition had been scheduled for March 25.</p><p>Other critics opined that Judge Wilson was splitting hairs in his order. &quot;Unlike too many jobs in this country there is no such thing as a licensed journalist,&quot; newspaper columnist Thomas Mitchell <a href=""https://elkodaily.com/opinion/columnists/thomas-mitchell-nevada-press-shield-law-protects-bloggers/article_431a34d6-e23f-5499-b2cf-30cfcc19edea.html"">wrote</a> in the Elko Daily Free Press.</p><p>Toll told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he would go to jail, if necessary, to protect his sources. But he worried that if this ruling stands, it could have a chilling effect on online media in Nevada.</p><p>&quot;It would be potentially devastating for people who report on matters of public interest to not be able to protect whistleblowers,&quot; Toll said. &quot;Do I relish going to jail? No. But for the people behind me, who currently have an online-only presence, I owe it to them to stand my ground.&quot;</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

After boisterous protests, including from pool photojournalists, Sanders conceded that one print reporter would be permitted to attend: Vivian Salama of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The four pool reporters who were barred: Jonathan Lemire of The Associated Press, Jeff Mason of Reuters, Justin Sink of Bloomberg News, and Eli Stokols of the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>The Washington Post reported that when Sanders was asked why the journalists representing the three largest wire services and a major newspaper were excluded, she said that it was because of “sensitivities over shouted questions in the previous sprays.”</p><p>During two brief photo opportunities on Wednesday night, American reporters—including Lemire and Mason—directed four questions at Trump; They asked Kim none.

The fact that this White House has done the opposite and excluded members of the press provides another sad example of its failure to uphold the American public’s right to see and be informed about President Trump’s activities.”</p><p>In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/whca/status/1100804535587692544"">statement</a>, Olivier Knox, White House Correspondents’ Association president, called the decision to exclude some of the journalists “capricious.” “This summit provides an opportunity for the American presidency to display its strength by facing vigorous questioning from a free and independent news media, not telegraph weakness by retreating behind arbitrary last-minute restrictions on coverage.”</p><p>Members of the press pool repeatedly asked Sanders whether North Korea was responsible for the restricted access, but she would not provide a direct answer. The ban came a day after the press pool was booted from the hotel where the White House had booked conference facilities to be used as a press workspace because Kim’s delegation had decided to stay at the same hotel.</p><p>In an emailed statement, Sanders said, “We are continuing to negotiate aspects of this historic summit and will always work to make sure the U.S. media has as much access as possible.”</p><p>The summit ended prematurely on Feb. 28.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

He said he followed his journalistic instinct and began to record the interaction.</p><p>After the officers finished searching the man’s bags and released him, Elk told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that an officer saw that he was recording and approached him, demanding to see his identification while the two other undercover officers “hovered” nearby. Elk identified himself as a journalist and told the officer that he felt within his rights to record them in a public space.</p><p>“The undercover cop told me that I was illegally wiretapping him,” Elk wrote in his account. The officer noted that Elk’s breath smelled of alcohol—Elk wrote that he had three Bud Lites on the train—and that he could be arrested for public intoxication as soon as he stopped outside the station.</p><p>When the officer repeated his demand that Elk show him identification, Elk handed the officer his passport, which Elk said was in his back pocket as he had just returned from Portugal. Elk wrote that the officer mocked him as “fancy” for having a passport, demanded to see his driver’s license and repeated his threat to arrest Elk once he left the train station.</p><p>“I showed [my driver’s license] to him and he said we are gonna check to see if they [sic] are any warrants out for your arrest,” Elk recounted.</p><p>Elk volunteered to erase the video he had taken of the officers’ interaction with the black man. “I informed the officer that I would erase the recording. Three cops crowded around me and watched as I deleted it,” Elk wrote. However, he continued, “the threats continued even after I erased the recording.</p><p>Elk wrote that after a few minutes he and the officer threatening arrest came to an agreement to walk away. A different officer approached him then and told Elk, “Why do you fuck with us? Don’t fuck with us and we won’t fuck with you.”</p><p>Elk said he was able to leave the station approximately five minutes after he had disembarked from the train. Elk wrote that he has reached out to the American Civil Liberties Union and plans to take legal action in order to assert the rights of journalists, and the public generally, to record incidents involving the police in public spaces.</p><p>“This is my hometown and I am not gonna be intimidated for standing up for racial justice,” Elk wrote.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Schmidle’s article included evidence strongly suggesting that Hood was innocent.</p><p>In January 2015, outgoing Illinois governor Pat Quinn <a href=""https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/01/13/quinn-commutes-sentence-of-man-convicted-of-lying-in-murder-case/"">commuted the prison sentences</a> of a number of prisoners, including Hood, on his last day in office. Because Hood received a commutation, not a pardon, he was let out of jail early but the murder conviction stayed on his record.</p><p>At the time, a spokeswoman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez told CBS 2 Chicago that Alvarez was “deeply disappointed” with the governor’s decision to commute Hood’s sentence.</p><p>Just a month later, though, Alvarez’s office announced that its Conviction Integrity Unit had completed a two-year investigation into Hood’s case, which concluded that Hood’s conviction should be vacated. Alvarez then <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-tyrone-hood-conviction-dismissed-met-0210-20150209-story.html"">asked a court to vacate Hood’s conviction</a>, which the court did. Hood was now out of prison and cleared of the murder conviction.</p><p>In 2016, Hood filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Chicago and a number of Chicago police officers, accusing them of pressuring witnesses into falsely accusing him of murder.</p><p>On Feb. 22, 2019, the defendants’ attorneys mailed the reporter Schmidle a document subpoena. The <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/4/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">extremely broad subpoena</a> ordered him to turn over, among other things, “All Documents Nicholas Schmidle received from any person or entity in connection with researching, investigating, preparing or publishing any of the Articles” about Hood. Schmidle’s attorneys <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/5/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">objected to the subpoena</a> on March 13, and the defendants seemed to drop it.</p><p>In June 2019, Schmidle was served with <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/6/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">a subpoena to testify in the case</a> and a <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/1/7/hood-v-city-of-chicago/"">second, more complete copy</a> of the same subpoena a week later.</p><p>Attorneys for both Hood and Schmidle have opposed the subpoenas for the reporter, arguing that a journalist’s documents and testimony are not relevant to a case that concerns the alleged behavior of Chicago police officers in the early 1990s.</p><p>Attorneys for the city of Chicago’s attorneys and the other defendants in Hood’s civil rights have argued that Schmidle’s testimony is essential, using a theory that puts Schmidle at the center of the action.</p><p>The defendants’ attorneys have argued that Hood’s civil rights were not violated because he actually is guilty of murder and his murder conviction should not have been vacated. They argue that journalists like Schmidle were tricked into writing a false narrative, which in turn prompted Governor Quinn to commute Hood’s sentence and pressure the state attorney’s office to get Hood’s conviction thrown out.</p><p>The current status of the Feb. 22 document subpoena is somewhat unclear. After Schmidle’s attorneys objected to the subpoena in March, the defendants never moved to compel Schmidle to turn over the documents. In effect, they dropped the subpoena. But on July 10, Schmidle received another copy of the document subpoena by email. Once again, Schmidle refused to turn over the documents and the defendants didn’t bother to press the matter.</p><p>Schmidle’s attorneys did not ask the judge to quash the document subpoena, but only because it seemed like the defendants had already given up on that one.</p><p>“Defendants have not moved to compel responses to the Document Subpoena, and therefore it is not at issue in this motion,” they wrote in the July 23 motion to quash the deposition subpoenas. That motion to quash was granted<a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15957074/12/hood-v-city-of-chicago/""> in October</a>.</p><p>Through a New Yorker spokeswoman, Schmidle declined to comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-08_at_12.56.4.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>A portion of the subpoena outlining broad requests for reporter Nicholas Schmidle&#x27;s work product</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['DROPPED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Lysiak told Patterson her name and phone number, and mentioned that she is a journalist.</p><p>Lysiak <a href=""https://orangestreetnews.com/2019/02/18/patagonia-marshal-theatens-to-arrest-osn-publisher-see-the-video/"">reported</a> in OSN that Patterson told her, “I don’t want to hear about any of that freedom-of-the-press stuff.” He added that he would arrest her and send her to juvenile detention. Later, Lysiak ran into Patterson again, but this time she was recording.</p><p>In the video, which Lysiak published to YouTube and OSN, she can be heard saying, “You stopped me earlier and you said that I can be thrown in juvie. What exactly am I doing that’s illegal?”</p><p>Patterson began to respond, but interrupted himself to ask if she was recording the encounter. “You can tape me, OK,” he is heard saying, “but what I’m going to tell you is if you put my face on the internet, it’s against the law in Arizona.”</p><p>There is no such law and recording a law enforcement officer in a public place is protected under the First Amendment, a fact noted by Lysiak in her article about the incident.</p><p>Patterson told her that he had noticed her trailing him as he responded to urgent calls around town, and accused her of disobeying his commands and lying about heading to a friend’s house (which she disputed). He also said that his concern was that she would be harmed by the mountain lion that had been seen wandering through that area of town. Finally, he told her, “I’ll be getting a hold of your parents,” and drove off.</p><p>Lysiak, whose father is also a journalist, knew her rights and published the video anyway.</p><p>The Nogales International <a href=""https://www.nogalesinternational.com/news/town-says-it-s-taken-action-after-marshal-s-encounter/article_c1192514-3585-11e9-87f1-7ba359bd40fc.html"">reported</a> that the town of Patagonia posted a statement to its website on Feb. 24, after receiving “many comments” regarding the interaction between Lysiak and Patterson. “The matter has been carefully reviewed and we have taken action we believe to be appropriate for the situation,” it said. The statement also noted that the town does not disclose personnel actions, including disciplinary actions, and would provide no further comment on the incident.</p><p>On Feb. 27, the town issued an apology during a Town Council meeting. In a <a href=""https://orangestreetnews.com/2019/02/28/town-of-patagonia-apologizes-to-osn-will-not-tolerate-any-further-restrictions-on-freedom-of-speech-see-the-video/"">video of the meeting</a> published by Lysiak, Patagonia Mayor Andrea Wood said, “The governing body of the town of Patagonia would like to apologize for the First Amendment rights violation inflicted upon Hilde Lysiak, a young reporter who is in our community. We are sorry Hilde, we encourage and respect your continued aspirations as a successful reporter.”</p><p>Lysiak made a name for herself in 2016, when she was the first to report on a grisly murder in her hometown of Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. Her continued reporting on local crime has garnered her many supporters, but also resulted in some threats. In January, Lysiak received threatening messages following her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ykAqEXooU"">reporting</a> on text message exchanges between an alleged drug dealer and his alleged accomplice in a car theft.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

During the screening, Rapalo was questioned about his work, and specifically his reporting along the U.S.-Mexico border. It was the third time in 2019 he was stopped by border patrol while on a reporting trip.</p><p>Rapalo, an American citizen, <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/hundreds-honduran-migrants-journey-190116155026749.html"">covered the migrant caravan</a> from Tijuana, Mexico for Al-Jazeera. Every time he has re-entered the U.S. since the beginning of 2019, he says, he has been pulled aside for a secondary screening. Rapalo believes that a flag or marker has been placed on his travel documents because border officials have consistently stopped him only after scanning his passport.</p><p>He said he was pulled aside in February when re-entering the U.S. in Miami from Haiti. He was previously stopped for secondary screening measures when returning from Mexico on <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-stopped-us-mexico-border-questioned-about-immigration-reporting/"">Jan. 5, when his notebooks were searched</a>, and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-stopped-border-second-time-camera-searched/"">Jan. 26, when his notebooks and photos on his camera were searched</a>.<br/></p><p>“When coming into Miami, an officer scanned my passport and immediately said, ‘Hmm, I guess we have to pull you aside, Mr. Rapalo,’” he said of the Feb. 16 stop.<br/></p><p>Although Rapalo was returning from Haiti, he was questioned about his work and reporting on the migrant caravan along the Mexican border. Then his notebooks were searched.<br/></p><p>One of his reporter notebooks included notes and information about the process of filing a Freedom of Information Act request, which he intended to do for his work.</p><p>“The officer took exception to this, and asked me why I was interested in filing FOIAs,” Rapalo said. “I told him, because I’m a journalist, and it’s one of the tools we have.”</p><p>Rapalo said during this border stop in Miami, an official who seemed to “like him” indicated that these stops would be an ongoing problem. “He said I could try Global Entry to make this go faster next time.”<br/></p><p>Global Entry is a government program for expediting international travel.<br/></p><p>Like the previous incidents, Rapalo said the secondary screenings began with about 30 minutes of questioning, then he was held for 1-2 hours while his luggage was searched. During this search, however, Rapalo said a large amount of attention focused on the paper receipts in his bag and wallet.<br/></p><p>Rapalo said that he has changed his behavior due to concerns about protecting his sources and reporting materials. He now brings new memory cards with him each time he travels for work.</p><p>CBP did not immediately respond to request for comment.<br/></p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

A computer program used to identify insider threats flagged suspicious activity on his work computer last fall, Lieutenant Commander Scott McBride, a service spokesman, <a href=""https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-coast-guard-maryland-attack-0222-story.html"">told the Baltimore Sun</a>.</p><p>McBride said that Hasson was arrested once Federal Bureau of Investigation and Coast Guard investigators were “confident in the strength of the evidence supporting the criminal complaint and warrant,” the The Sun reported.</p><p>Law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on his basement apartment in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland, and seized 15 firearms, two silencers, over 100 pills of the opioid painkiller tramadol, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Officers also found a spreadsheet listing potential targets, including MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN’s Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo and Van Jones.</p><p>Prosecutors say Hasson used his government computer to plot an assault, researching potential locations to target politicians and studying the writings of domestic terrorists including the Unabomber and the Virginia Tech shooter, The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/ex-coast-guard-lieutenant-ordered-held-for-14-days-while-government-weighs-terrorism-related-charges-in-his-planning-of-widespread-terrorist-attack/2019/02/21/57918f12-3573-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html?utm_term=.4d03949a4fb4"">reported</a>.</p><p>In documents recovered from Hasson’s computer, he described himself as a “long time White Nationalist.” The Post reported that according to court documents, Hasson called for “focused violence” to “establish a white homeland.”</p><p>“The sheer number and force of the weapons recovered from Mr. Hasson’s residence in this case, coupled with the disturbing nature of his writing, appear to reflect a very significant threat to the safety of our community,” Robert Hur, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, told The Sun, “particularly given the position of trust that Mr. Hasson held with the United States government.”</p><p>A grand jury indicted Hasson on Feb. 27 on charges of illegal possession of firearm silencers, possession of firearms by a drug addict and unlawful user, and possession of a controlled substance. His court hearing has not yet been scheduled, but Hasson has been detained since his arrest on Feb. 15.</p><p>Prosecutors told The Post that Hasson could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted: 10 years for each of the weapons charges and one year for the possession of tramadol.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

A bunch of people were yelling about getting shoved.”</p><p>McLeod said that the Capitol Police officers physically prevented reporters from interviewing senators, even though the senators were willing to talk to the press.</p><p>“I have never seen them do what they did today, which was forming a protective circle around senators to keep press away,” he said. “The senators were just walking in to a vote like normal and the police were doing it to everyone. There was no sign the senators were requesting it.”</p><p>Laslo, one of the reporters who was shoved,<a href=""https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/capitol-police-crackdown-press-escalates-physical-altercation""> gave a similar account</a> to the political news site Roll Call.</p><p>“[Sen. Dianne] Feinstein was doing an interview with one reporter, and she just stopped and her jaw just dropped,” Laslo said. “She was confused. She was just unable to keep doing an interview that she wanted to do because the officers were creating such a mess.”</p><p>Roll Call, which obtained a recording of the altercation, reported that a Capitol Police officer could be heard telling journalists that they were violating the law.</p><p>“That’s a violation,” the Capitol Police officer reportedly said to the reporters walking alongside the senators. “Surrounding them — we lock people up for that. If the public does that, they get locked up.”</p><p>Both McLeod and Laslo said that the Capitol Police officers’ aggressive tactics were unprecedented.</p><p>“There were no more reporters there than there are any day of any week,” McLeod said.</p><p>“This was first time any officer put their hands on me or my co-workers in front of me, so it was really disheartening,” Laslo told Roll Call.</p><p>The Feb. 14 altercation came in the midst of heated confrontations between members of Congress and journalists.</p><p>The day before, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez accused Henry Rodgers, a reporter from the right-wing news site The Daily Caller, of harassing him and threatened to call the police.</p><p>“I won’t answer questions to the Daily Caller, period!” Menendez said,<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/menendez-threatens-to-call-capitol-police-after-reporter-asks-him-about-green-new-deal""> according to Rodgers’ recording</a> of the conversation. “You’re trash … Don’t keep harassing me anymore or I’ll race to the Capitol Police!”</p><p>Menendez did not follow through on his threat to involve the Capitol Police.</p><p>On Feb. 14, Roll Call reports, the Capitol Police were on high alert after receiving reports that a certain individual — a former journalist and political tracker with a reputation for aggressively confronting conservative politicians — had been spotted in the area.</p><p>McLeod said that the presence of the political tracker shouldn’t excuse the Capitol Police’s aggressive treatment of the press in the Senate basement.</p><p>“Looks like it was all an absurd over-reaction because this [political tracker] was apparently somewhere around,” he said. “But the thing is he can&#x27;t get into the actual capitol and that is where this took place. We were in an area past a security checkpoint where you needed to have ID or be a guest of someone to get in. So the whole thing made no sense.”</p><p>The National Press Club also<a href=""https://www.press.org/news-multimedia/news/national-press-club-criticizes-capitol-police-manhandling-reporters""> released a statement</a> criticizing the Capitol Police response as an over-reaction.</p><p>“Capitol Police dramatically over-reacted on Thursday and did more harm than good when they prevented accredited reporters from doing their job and further obstructed senators from communicating with the press,” NPC president Alison Fitzgerald Kodjak said in a statement. “There was no call for the police to shove or place their hands on the reporters.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Jenna Garland, press secretary for former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, was cited with two violations of the act and is accused of ordering a subordinate in the city’s Department of Watershed Management to delay handing over public records containing information damaging to Reed and other city officials in March 2017.</p><p>On March 7, 2017, WSB-TV Channel 2 Action News filed a records request for “billing, payment and usage records,” according to the citation. It alleges that Garland “knowingly and willingly attempt[ed] to frustrate the access to records not subject to exemption” by instructing then-watershed spokeswoman Lillian Govus via text message to “[d]rag this out as long as possible [a]nd provide information in the most confusing format available.”</p><p>The second citation alleges that Garland similarly obstructed a second records request from Channel 2, filed on March 21, 2017, when Garland instructed Govus to “‘[h]old all’ documents responsive to the request until the requestor asked for an update” via text message on April 7, 2017.</p><p>The texts were obtained and <a href=""https://www.ajc.com/news/local/action-needed-texts-show-kasim-reed-role-records-request/ayGINvRtGAjp1CgjlLwNoO/"">reported</a> on by Channel 2 and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in May 2018.</p><p>It is exceedingly rare for a public official to face consequences for obstructing public records requests, Jonathan Peters, media law professor at the University of Georgia, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “It’s not uncommon for state records laws to have those penalties built in to them,” he said. “What is really uncommon is to see a prosecutor actually use them.”</p><p>Peters said public records law violations aren’t often worthwhile for prosecutors to pursue given the challenge of securing a conviction under one of the criminal provisions of the law. “Good faith” is a defense built into many open records laws, including Georgia’s ORA.</p><p>“A good faith defense is so elastic and subjective that it’s not a terribly difficult defense for a public official to make,” Peters said.</p><p>When cases are pursued, he said, it is when the violations are so flagrant that they can’t be ignored.</p><p>“I think it’s the particularly bad facts of this case, where screenshots of the actual text messages are so clearly evidence of an effort to frustrate the public records law, that it is reasonably impossible to look at the behavior of Jenna Garland and see anything resembling good faith,” Peters said.</p><p>Violations of the ORA are misdemeanors, and if convicted Garland faces up to a $1,000 fine. She could also face up to a $2,500 fine for the second citation, depending on how the judge decides to hear the allegations.</p><p>“Openness and transparency in government are vital to upholding the public trust,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a news release on the citations on Feb. 11, 2019. “I am confident that this action sends a clear message that the Georgia Open Records Act will be enforced.”</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

BGA detailed the context of this order in an <a href=""https://www.bettergov.org/news/cook-judge-bars-publication-of-documents-about-student-drowning-raising-free-press-concerns"">article</a> published on Feb. 7, 2019.</p><p>The article reported that a CPS lawyer supplied BGA with requested investigative files and internal records on Jan. 24. Four days later, the school’s lawyers asked for their return and the destruction of any copies that had been made, claiming that their release had been a mistake.</p><p>The lawsuit and files pertained to a 2017 BGA and Chicago Sun-Times <a href=""https://www.bettergov.org/news/autistic-teens-death-in-cps-pool-heightens-questions-of-special-ed-care"">investigation</a> which revealed that a 14-year-old boy with autism was permitted to enter a school pool with neither direct supervision nor a life vest. They reported that the boy drowned within minutes.</p><p>When BGA refused to return the released files, CPS attorney Mara Warman asked Circuit Court Judge Peter Flynn during a hearing on Feb. 4 to “claw back” the records. Flynn ruled in their favor, ordering that BGA delay publishing the records until at least Feb. 20. Following an emergency request from BGA to vacate that order, Flynn reaffirmed his ruling on Feb 6.</p><p>“Just hold your horses,” Flynn said during the second hearing, BGA reported. “There is no emergency here in any meaningful way… I don’t think it’s a prior restraint. I think it’s efficient management of a case.”</p><p>BGA attorney Matt Topic disagreed. “You have the press, which has a highly relevant, important document that they obtained through nothing illegal and you are restraining them from publishing that document where they have an ethical and professional obligation,” Topic said.</p><p>Bob Secter, senior editor for BGA, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that Topic reached out to the deceased child’s parents to have them sign a paper authorizing the release of the materials. Based on that release, Flynn vacated his order to delay publication. Some of the documents did have the names of child witnesses to the incident redacted, as well as their social security numbers and other private information.</p><p>BGA published an <a href=""https://www.bettergov.org/news/chicago-public-schools-to-pay-4m-in-special-ed-teens-drowning"">article</a> on Feb. 8 about the judge vacating the original order and what was in the documents.</p><p>“This started as a simple FOIA case,” Secter told the Tracker about BGA’s use of the Freedom of Information Act. “We wrote a story with the Chicago Sun-Times reconstructing that incident and how it came about and who might have been responsible and who made mistakes. As part of the reporting on that, we issued a FOIA… As the Chicago Public School does, they basically blanket deny everything, so we filed a lawsuit, and they fought us for well over a year.”</p><p>The child’s parents had also sued CPS for wrongful death, reaching a $4 million settlement which was approved by the Illinois Board of Education the day before the documents requested in the FOIA were released to BGA.</p><p>“[The prior restraint] was entirely out of the ordinary. Outside of national security cases this doesn’t happen, and, not to minimize what we did, but it was an everyday case about a tragic accident and the subsequent legal case,” Secter said.</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court precedent has held that prior restraint—in which government officials seek to block information from becoming public—is <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prior_restraint"">unconstitutional</a> in all but the most extreme circumstances.<br/></p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Later, Chapo Trap House podcast co-host Will Menaker was added to the lawsuit.</p><p>The subpoena orders Bloom to produce communications he may have had with Krueger or Delgado. It also demanded any of Bloom’s reporting materials on investigations into Miller’s sexual relationships, including notes, memos, or records created during his research.</p><p>Bloom was served the subpoena at his home on the evening of Feb. 5.

Vogt of Bajo Cuva Cohen &amp; Turkel PA did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>In an interview with the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Bloom took particular issue with the subpoena’s demand for relevant social media posts, including tweets. He noted that Miller had blocked Bloom on Twitter, so if Miller wanted copies of his tweets, he could simply unblock him and view the posts.</p><p>When a process server called him, Bloom said he was asked if he knew where to find reporter Yashar Ali, indicating that he would also receive a subpoena.</p><p>Ali did not immediately respond to requests for comment and questions as to whether he was also served a subpoena by Miller’s legal team.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The DOJ <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/leak-investigations-rise-800-under-jeff-sessions"">has indicated they have dozens more</a> leak investigations active, and the Trump DOJ is on pace to prosecute more sources of journalists than any other administration before it.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint unsealed on Feb. 21, 2019, DOJ has accused Fry of searching for Cohen’s name and company in two government financial databases, downloading “suspicious activity reports,” or SARs, and sending information he found to attorney Michael Avenatti, who has represented adult entertainer Stormy Daniels in her accusations against President Trump, as well as an unidentified reporter at the New Yorker.</p><p>In May 2018, the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow published an investigation into Cohen’s suspicious overseas financial transactions that may have related to 2016 election activities, titled “<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/missing-files-motivated-the-leak-of-michael-cohens-financial-records"">Missing Files Motivated Leak of Michael Cohen’s Financial Records</a>.” The title and quotes from the article match those cited in the complaint.</p><p>In the article, an unidentified source is quoted by Farrow justifying why it was important that the public know about Cohen’s suspicious financial transactions: “‘I have never seen something pulled off the system. . . . That system is a safeguard for the bank. It’s a stockpile of information. When something’s not there that should be, I immediately became concerned.’ The official added, ‘That’s why I came forward.’”</p><p>The DOJ claims it obtained WhatsApp messages between Fry and the unidentified reporter, assumed to be Farrow. It is unclear how the DOJ obtained these messages, or whether the DOJ has attempted to access communications records directly from Farrow or any other reporters potentially connected to this case.</p></div></div>

The meeting was arranged by Alderman Danny Solis, who chairs the Chicago City Council Zoning Committee.</p><p>The story cites a federal court affidavit: “The details of the allegations against Solis are contained in a 2016 search warrant application filed by federal prosecutors seeking to search Solis’ City Hall office, campaign and ward office, homes and a North Side massage parlor where Solis allegedly received free sex acts.”</p><p>A week after the Sun-Times article, the business news site Chicago Business <a href=""https://www.chicagobusiness.com/greg-hinz-politics/story-behind-solis-revelations-rocked-chicago"">published a story behind the story</a>. Citing anonymous sources, Chicago Business outlines how the affidavit was filed as part of an FBI request for a search warrant on Solis, a request that should have been sealed. Instead, it was mistakenly posted on PACER, a site through which the public can access federal court records. While it was temporarily available, the Sun-Times seemingly downloaded the document after it was published on PACER.</p><p>Chicago Business reports that Magistrate Judge Young Kim ordered the Sun-Times not to publish the details of the document, “presumably on grounds that premature publicity could undermine what appears to be an extremely wide-ranging federal probe into City Hall that has been underway for four years or longer.”</p><p>The Sun-Times reportedly defied this court order, and published the information contained in the document anyway.

The letters said the list they received was “confidential” and disclosed “inadvertently”.

They did that the first time!” Paladino told Freedom of the Press Foundation, noting that POST released an unrelated document to the reporters before correcting the mistake and sending the responsive record.</p><p>Paladino and Lewis have not published the list itself, though a report in the East Times Bay about the legal threat used several examples of California police officers convicted of crimes.</p><p>“Part of the reason we haven’t published is to do due diligence,” Lewis said.</p><p>Freedom of the Press Foundation followed up with the attorney general’s office to clarify whether it recognized any of the serious First Amendment concerns with the letter, and received a statement through a spokesperson from Attorney General Becerra. His response included no reference to the First Amendment:</p><p>“We always strive to balance the public’s right to know, the need to be transparent and an individual’s right to privacy. In this case, information from a database that’s required by law to be confidential was released erroneously, jeopardizing personal data of individuals across our state.

If they were successful, sources would be reluctant to contact reporters or fear they should be outed with a subpoena,” Kraft told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>In their emergency motion to quash, the lawyer for Edgar County Watchdogs, Denise M. Ambroziak, wrote that the subpoena both “violates the reporter’s privilege” and “lacks relevance to the subject matter of the FOIA suit, is outside of the scope, and fails to comply with local rules.”</p><p>Edgar County Watchdogs is currently suing Algonquin Township for failing to provide records in response to 16 different public records requests, and the subpoena was issued in the context of that lawsuit. “Instead of just answering our FOIA requests they’re spending all this money to try and find out who is feeding us information,” Kraft said.</p><p>Ambroziak argued in the motion that Algonquin Township had not met the threshold to divest reporter’s privilege. Under Illinois law, the party seeking to do so must prove such information being sought would be relevant to the proceeding, that such information is in the public interest, and that they have exhausted all other means of obtaining that information. “There is no public interest supported by disclosing the contents of the Plaintiff’s Dropbox Account other than to simply go on an improper fishing expedition for some undisclosed and unknown reason,” the motion continues.</p><p>Neither Kraft nor his attorney received a copy of the subpoena via electronic or postal mail, and did not become aware of its existence until a third party provided it to them on Feb. 8, according to the motion. Also on that day, James Kelly, the lawyer for Algonquin Township, wrote a letter to the lawyer for Edgar County Watchdogs stating that the subpoena was “rejected and cannot be served,” and so there was no need to file the emergency motion to quash the subpoena. They opted to file the motion anyway, and it was granted on Feb. 11, <a href=""https://edgarcountywatchdogs.com/2019/02/mchenry-court-quashes-algonquin-townships-attack-on-media-and-first-amendment/"">according</a> to Kraft and an <a href=""https://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/511776066-judge-quashes-algonquin-township-s-effort-to-subpoena-edgar-county-watchdogs-dropbox-records"">article</a> in the Cook County Record.</p><p>Kelly and Township Clerk Karen Lukasik did not return multiple requests for comment.</p><p>Edgar County Watchdogs is a investigative blog based in southern Illinois that focuses on local government transparency. <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/01/government-accountability-local-watchdogs-citizen-action-makes-big-difference/"">According</a> to the National Review, the investigative work conducted by Kraft and co-founder Kirk Allen has resulted in &quot;seven ongoing federal investigations.&quot;<br/></p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Belin told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she first sought information about press credentials in the Iowa House of Representatives in early 2019. Since then, officials have denied her requests for credentials or access to press work areas multiple times, each time citing different reasons that did not align with written policies in place. Both the House and the Senate have also changed press qualification criteria since her first application.</p><p>When Belin first sought credentials in the House, the clerk at the time, Carmine Boal, told her by email on Jan. 3, 2019, that credentials “are not issued to members of the public.”</p><p>Boal referenced Iowa House rules, which did not elaborate on qualifications for the press. She also told Belin the House consulted<a href=""https://periodical.house.gov/accreditation/rules-and-regulations""> U.S. congressional press gallery rules</a>, which would not appear to disqualify Belin. Boal never responded to multiple requests for further explanation from Belin.</p><p>Boal stood by the denial of Belin’s credentials in a statement <a href=""https://apnews.com/df3c7ecdcf90431daf729a1fb7ac7fe4"">to The Associated Press</a> but did not elaborate on why she did not meet the chamber’s rules that restricted access to the press box to “representatives of the press, radio, and television.”</p><p>After the Iowa Freedom of Information Council wrote to Boal expressing concerns about Belin’s rejection, Boal responded on Feb. 5 that House rules “do not offer a definition” of members of the media, and again pointed to congressional rules. In a copy of the response letter provided to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, she wrote that online outlets are not excluded and said that credentials are not denied based on content. However, she also said that the House has not “credentialed any ‘non-traditional media’ since 2015,” a policy that did not appear in writing.</p><p>Belin also applied for access to desks reserved for members of the press in the Iowa Senate in January 2019. She was initially told that she could access vacant spaces on day passes. However, Belin said she was never issued a day pass, even when the desks were not in use</p><p>Both the House and the Senate updated their press policies after Belin’s initial inquiries, according to the <a href=""https://apnews.com/64d897b25c9c8918d5be95f5e63797a8"">AP</a>. The House updated its<a href=""https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/CCDOC/1050120.pdf""> policy</a> in February 2019 to include requirements that credentialed press be “bona fide correspondents of repute” and a “paid correspondent.” Bleeding Heartland is editorially independent and a registered business. Belin, as its owner, is entitled to any proceeds.</p><p>Belin applied for press credentials for the 2020 legislative session. She was denied credentials from the House on Jan. 10, 2020. House Clerk Meghan Nelson told her in an email that the House does not credential “outlets that are nontraditional/independent in nature.” This requirement is not included in the Iowa House press policy.</p><p>The Senate abolished media credentials and adopted a new <a href=""https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/SSDOC/1126281.pdf"">reserved work space policy</a>, in place for the 2020 legislative session, which guides access to desks in the Senate chamber reserved for media and Senate staff.</p><p>On Jan. 10, Belin received an email from Secretary of the Senate Charlie Smithson notifying her that “it has been determined that you do not meet the criteria to be a ‘member of the media’” under the Senate’s work space policy. Correspondence provided by Belin shows that Smithson did not respond to her multiple requests for further explanation of what criteria she did not meet under the policy.</p><p>Belin told the Tracker that press freedom protections are not just for journalists pulling a full-time salary. She suspects she was denied access because her approach differs from the “traditional objectivity stance.”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s constitutional for them to exclude me because they don’t like the opinions on my website,” Belin said.</p><p>Iowa House and Senate officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/LauraBelinheadshot.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>Political blogger Laura Belin has been repeatedly denied press access to the Iowa Statehouse. &quot;I don’t think it’s constitutional for them to exclude me because they don’t like the opinions on my website,” Belin said.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

A federal magistrate judge quashed the subpoena on Aug. 9, and a federal district court judge affirmed that decision on Nov. 12.</p><p>Michael Johnson, the plaintiff, alleges in his civil lawsuit filed in November 2016 that he was discriminated against at FDNY due to his status as an African American &quot;priority hire&quot; who joined the department in 2014. He was hired following a court order to remedy historically discriminatory hiring practices at FDNY. Johnson alleges that he was the subject of strategic leaks to the media intended to portray him as a coward who refused to fight fires.</p><p>Edelman was the co-author of a May 2015 New York Post story titled &quot;Firefighters fear colleague who routinely flees fires.&quot; The piece began, &quot;He&#x27;s a firefighter in name only. Michael D. Johnson won&#x27;t fight fires. Instead, he stays on the sidelines as his Engine Company 257 colleagues rush into burning buildings, FDNY insiders told the Post.&quot;</p><p>The 2019 subpoena was issued demanding Edelman appear at a Jan. 29 deposition at the New York office of one of Johnson&#x27;s attorneys. After negotiations with Johnson&#x27;s attorneys and several extensions granted by the court, Edelman&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion to quash the subpoena on June 4.</p><p>Edelman penned an affidavit in support of the motion, in which she argues the importance of keeping the identities of her sources confidential. &quot;My reporting for the Post includes investigating corruption, waste, and misconduct within government agencies in New York City,&quot; she writes. &quot;The municipal government sources who provide me information on these and other issues could be subject to serious professional discipline—or even lose their job—for speaking with me. It is therefore absolutely critical that my sources trust that I will maintain their confidentiality.&quot;</p><p>Lawyers for Johnson argued in court filings that Edelman had waived her reporter&#x27;s privilege because she, in a 2015 phone call with one of Johnson’s attorneys, mentioned she was getting a call on another line from Jake Lemonda, a FDNY battalion chief. Edelman&#x27;s attorney, Robert Balin, disagreed, writing in a filing, &quot;Ms. Edelman said nothing about the substance of any conversations she had with Mr. Lemonda, whether he provided her with any information, or if he did, whether any information he provided was used in—or even connected to—the Article.&quot;</p><p>Vera M. Scanlon, a federal magistrate judge, granted the order quashing the subpoena on Aug. 9. The plaintiff’s counsel filed an objection to Scanlon&#x27;s order, writing that the judge &quot;erred when she found that all of Edelman&#x27;s discussions with her sources were confidential&quot; and that the &quot;standard for non-confidentiality ought to apply.&quot;</p><p>On Nov. 12, U.S. District Court Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto affirmed Scanlon&#x27;s order granting Edelman&#x27;s motion to quash the subpoena. &quot;Judge Scanlon properly exercised her discretion when she held that Edelman&#x27;s sources and other newsgathering information with respect to the Article were confidential and that plaintiff did not overcome his burden to compel disclosure of Edelman&#x27;s information,&quot; she found.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2019-11-22_at_7.39.10.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A portion of the 2019 subpoena seeking information on confidential sources from New York Post reporter Susan Edelman.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,testimony about confidential source,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

The second stop included a search of his equipment.</p><p>The filmmaker, a foreign citizen who is based in the U.S., told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that in December 2018 he was crossing the San Ysidro border near San Diego, California, when <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/independent-filmmaker-stopped-while-crossing-us-mexico-border/"">he was stopped and held</a> for several hours after being recognized for his work by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent.</p><p>Not quite a week later, he said, he was stopped at the same border point while re-entering Mexico to continue his work.</p><p>About 1 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019, a CBP agent took the passports of the filmmaker and a friend with whom he was traveling.</p><p>Usually, the filmmaker said, a secondary screening has a specific protocol: The agent puts the passport in an orange slip and tucks the slip under a wiper on the front windshield. This time, he said, the protocol was very different.</p><p>The agent kept the two passports, asked the filmmaker for his wallet and told him and his friend to leave the car. The filmmaker was then taken inside the CBP office, where he waited for 30-40 minutes.</p><p>Plainclothes officers began asking questions, he said, most notably about if he’d been in any face-off with officers or if he had any involvement in a specific New Year’s Eve incident. On Dec. 31, 2018, CBP agents <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/border-patrol-migrants-tear-gas-mexico-1276529"">fired tear gas across the border</a> near Tijuana, Mexico.</p><p>The filmmaker also said the agents asked if he “knew of any group or people who were agitators.”</p><p>The filmmaker said he answered the questions and then the agents asked him to unlock his phone. He did so, he said, because he didn’t want to escalate the situation and get into a confrontation with the agents.</p><p>“By this time it’s almost 2 a.m.,” the filmmaker said, “And the whole situation is intimidating.”</p><p>After about 15 minutes with his phone, the agents returned and asked him to unlock it again. They also asked for his email and phone number.</p><p>“I don’t think anything was missing from my phone,” the filmmaker said, “But they had full access to everything — my contacts, my photos, my social media.”</p><p>All told, he said, he was held for about 2 hours. His friend’s car was searched and she was brought in and questioned as well.</p><p>The filmmaker said he has no plans to go back because he is done filming. He did ask that his name not be used for fear of reprisal.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has detailed <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/border-stop/?categories=5&amp;tags=102"">nearly a dozen border stops</a> of journalists following the migrant caravan.

Every time he has re-entered the U.S. since then, he says, he has been pulled aside for a secondary screening, in what Rapalo calls his “new routine.”</p><p>Rapalo believes that a flag or marker has been placed on his travel documents because border officials have consistently stopped him only after scanning his passport. The Jan. 5 secondary screening was his first time to be pulled aside—he was also stopped for <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-stopped-border-second-time-camera-searched/"">additional screening on Jan. 26</a> and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-stopped-border-third-time-questioned-about-his-work-and-foia-request/"">Feb. 16</a>, where the photos on his camera were searched and he was questioned about public records requests he intends to file.</p><p>“The first question was, ‘Why did you have trouble at the border?’” Rapalo said, referring to his reporting on the US-Mexico border. “I don’t know how he could have even known that. And then they asked me about my work along the border.”</p><p>According to Rapalo, the secondary screening began with about 30 minutes of questioning, then he was held for 1-2 hours while his luggage was searched.</p><p>“They go through my reporter notebooks, receipts, and ask me about the nature of my work, and how long I’ve been doing the job and whether I do fake news,” he told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. “I tell them to Google me. It seems like they are trying to get information out of me related to the border, like gathering intelligence on why the media is interested in the border.”</p><p>Rapalo said that while reporting from Tijuana on New Year’s Eve 2018, officials with Customs and Border Protection accused him and other journalists of exploiting migrants for stories and even “bringing them here from the shelters.”</p><p>“CBP tells people at the border hoping to cross that the journalists are taking advantage of them, and that they are there to make money off of them,” Rapalo said.</p><p>He said he responded to these accusations by stating that, “I can’t speak for everyone else, but I’m just here to watch and witness.”</p><p>CBP did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p><i>— The</i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Obviously, this scares off potential listeners as well as guests and experts we reach out to. In addition to this, it allows corporate media to refer to us as ‘foreign agents’ without clarifying what that means, which again creates a notion that we are spies of sort and not journalists.”</p><p>In a <a href=""https://www.cjr.org/analysis/fara-press.php"">2018 article for Columbia Journalism Review</a>, staff at the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote that “in invoking FARA, Congress is relying on a notoriously opaque unit within the Department of Justice to draw an impossible line between propaganda and journalism.

The judge ultimately ruled that she could not be forced to reveal the source’s identity. <br/><br/>Bruce Bernstein, an employee at Rockmore Capital and the <a href=""http://www.teribuhl.com/2018/09/19/rockmore-capitals-bruce-bernstein-ex-wife-outs-him-for-possible-sec-violations-in-xspa-deal/"">subject of a story by Buhl on securities fraud</a>, filed a lawsuit alleging that Buhl had use a document in her reporting from his divorce filings that was under seal. </p><p>“Bernstein is entitled to pre-action discovery that will allow him to determine who - the Binn Parties, their counsel, Aufrichtig or a party currently unknown to Bernstein - sent the Document and email to Buhl,” reads the pre-discovery petition filed December 2018.<br/><br/>Manhattan Judge W. Franc Perry sealed the lawsuit, preventing the public from ascertaining the details of the lawsuit for months after it was filed.  <br/><br/>“I was still reporting on securities fraud, but I couldn’t report that they were suing me and bullying me,” Buhl told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. <br/><br/>On Jan. 18, Buhl wrote on her news website, Smashmouth Investigative Journalism, that a subject of her reporting was <a href=""http://www.teribuhl.com/2019/01/18/ny-court-case-putting-journalist-source-protection-at-risk/"">attempting to force her to disclose a source</a>, and that she was fighting back. <br/><br/>Buhl’s attorneys filed an opposition to the application to seal the records, and filed in support of the motion to dismiss the pre-action disclosure petition on Jan. 28. <br/><br/>“In a desperate bid to keep potentially damaging information from public view, Petitioner seeks to upend bedrock constitutional principles protecting both the public’s right to access the courts and the free exchange of ideas,” the opposition reads. “Petitioner has brought this special proceeding under CPLR 3102(c), in part, to compel Ms. Buhl, a seasoned investigative journalist, to reveal confidential source information relating to her reporting on Petitioner’s possible SEC violations.”<br/></p><p>On March 5, the judge ruled that Buhl could not be forced to disclose her confidential source. Buhl said that on the Friday before, March 1, the judge had ruled in favor of a motion by Buhl’s attorneys to unseal the case. </p><p>The dismissal of Bernstein’s petition for pre-discovery cites reporters’ ability to protect their sources:  “...[G]iven New York’s long tradition of protecting freedom of the press and recognizing the critical role that the press plays in our democratic society, Ms. Buhl, as a professional journalist, is protected by the Shield Law, which was enacted to provide the highest level of protection in the nation for those which gather and report the news and to promote the free flow of dissemination.” </p><p>On March 4, Buhl updated the post on her website to note that numerous news organizations and press freedom groups, including the New York Times and Reporters without Borders, had joined an amicus brief in support. </p><p>“This is an important win because it confirms that the New York shield law applies to freelance journalists like Teri Buhl, who self-publish on their own news sites,” said Sarah Matthews, staff attorney for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which submitted <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-28-Anonymous-v-Anoymous-Teri-Buhl.pdf"">its own friend-of-the-court brief </a>in January. “Unsealing this case was particularly important because it involved an attempt to force a journalist to reveal her source.” </p><p>The Press Freedom Defense Fund provided the legal funding for Buhl’s case. (<i>Full disclosure: Matthews provides intake for the Fund and sits on the steering committee for the Tracker.</i>)</p><p>Buhl agreed that the judge’s ruling helps all freelancers in New York.</p><p>“It’s alarming that a state court judge even agreed to seal this case before any hearing took place, based on what one Wall Street lawyer said in his motion,” said Buhl said. “Pre-action discovery cannot be used as a fishing expedition to get reporters’ sources.” </p><p>Buhl also told the Tracker that she could think of no circumstance under which she would comply with such a legal order and reveal the identity of a source. </p><p>“I would rather be held in contempt,” she said. </p><p>Bernstein did not respond to request for comment by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

At the check-in counter, Farouky heard the employee who had his paperwork tell another employee, “I’ve got someone here relating to those two words that I can’t say.”</p><p>“I was like, what are those two words?” Farouky said. “Why would you say that in front of me?”</p><p>Whatever those two words were, Farouky was pulled aside for an interview by the Department of Homeland Security. He said the interview didn’t surprise him. While securing his visa for the trip, an embassy representative told him he might be interviewed again while traveling. Plus, he said, he is used to it.</p><p>“This time,” Farouky said, “This DHS guy showed up and questioned me for 10 minutes. There were some questions about my work, and also strange questions about whether I had family in the United States—he wanted to know if they were ‘OK,’ or if they had medical issues. When I mentioned living in Morocco in the past, he kept bringing up this story in which two Scandinavian hikers were killed by an ISIS affiliate. The story is horrifying, but he kept bringing it up over and over. It felt like maybe he was phishing to see my reaction.”</p><p>After he was told by DHS that he was good to go, Farouky said his luggage was given an additional swab to test for explosives, and then he boarded his flight to Florida. But upon landing, he said he was quickly pulled aside again.</p><p>“I sat there for a long time while someone asked me questions, and it focused on my travel history. He brought up Syria a lot, which I visited in 2009 before the United States’ cutoff date to visit the country.”</p><p>Farouky said a border agent then asked for his phone, and requested him to unlock it. The border officials did not ask him for his passcode.</p><p>“I didn’t know what my rights were,” Farouky said. “I asked, ‘What if I am not comfortable with that?’ And they said the only other option was sending my phone to a private company, which meant I wouldn’t get it back for weeks.”</p><p>Border agents <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/border-enforcement-airport-phones.html"">cannot force travelers to unlock their phones or laptops</a>, but they can ask them to do so and escalate the situation. If travelers refuse, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/border-enforcement-airport-phones.html"">officials can seize the devices and copy the data</a>.</p><p>Farouky said he was worried about his contacts, both personal and professional. “If they harvested all of the names and numbers, that’s everyone I have ever interviewed, so my sources could be put in some sort of database. But I didn’t feel like I had a choice.”</p><p>He said he felt intensely uncomfortable, but unlocked his phone and gave it to the officials. Farouky said they told him they were just looking for evidence of illegal activity. The border agents then took his phone into another room, returning it after about five minutes, Farouky said. When it was returned, it was on airplane mode.</p><p><a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/PIA-CBP%20-%20Border-Searches-of-Electronic-Devices%20-January-2018%20-%20Compliant.pdf"">A 2018 Customs and Border Protection directive</a> requires officials to ensure that prior to a search, devices are not connected to the internet, so that searches only involve content that is stored locally on the device.</p><p>Farouky also noted that at no point was he offered a piece of paper detailing his rights in the situation. He also said that he was concerned that pushing back would only spike the authorities’ interest in his devices and work.</p><p>“I certainly didn’t want them looking at my laptop. I’m not even doing hardcore investigative work,” he said.</p><p>DHS did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Farouky emphasized that this kind of incident is not uncommon for him, and that he has been questioned by authorities while traveling and asked to unlock his devices at other times. He said in a Tel Aviv airport around 2009, Israeli authorities asked him to unlock his phone and he refused. And a few years ago in New York, he was interrogated in what he called a much ruder and longer fashion. There, his phone was taken but not unlocked.</p><p>“I don’t have any doubt that this is because I am a Muslim, a Palestinian, and a journalist. It really pissed me off intellectually,” Farouky said.</p><p><i>— The </i><a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

Sheets later <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx3UwzBgMRs"">posted the video</a> recorded by his body camera on YouTube.</p><p>The video shows Sheets entering the City Hall Annex building and going to the city clerk’s office, where he makes a request for a copy of the ordinance. Two city hall staffers who appear on the video tell Sheets that they do not have their permission and film them and ask him to stop recording.</p><p>“You don’t have our permission to record us,” one of the staffers tells Sheets.</p><p>“You’re a public official in a public building,” Sheets replies.</p><p>“This is a staff area,” the staffer says. “It’s not a public meeting area.”</p><p>Later in the video, Sheets goes to the Punta Gorda police station and asks to speak with the police chief. An officer, later identified as Lt. Justin Davoult, then approaches him in the lobby to inform them that the police chief will not speak with him. Davoult also issues two trespass warnings to Sheets, which ban Sheets from returning to Punta Gorda City Hall and City Hall Annex for one year.</p><p>“Before we go any further, this is what we’re going to do,” Davoult tells Sheets in the video. “The chief’s not available to speak to you. OK, so this is what you’ve got. This is a trespass warning for City Hall and City Annex, OK, for both addresses over at City Hall. You are no longer to be at or on that property for a period of one year or you will face arrest.”<br/></p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Sheets later filed a personnel complaint against Davoult, accusing him of “unlawful trespass issued.” The police department conducted an internal investigation, which cleared Davoult of any wrongdoing.</p><p>“The circumstances detailed on Dec. 20, 2018 confirmed that Andrew Sheets was in violation of the city ordinance,” the investigation report states. “This investigation has determined Lieutenant Justin Davoult’s actions were lawful, proper, and consistent with department policy and therefore is Exonerated from the allegation of unlawful trespass issued.”</p><p>Sheets believes that the prohibition on filming in Punta Gorda City Hall may be unconstitutional.</p><p>In April 2017, the Punta Gorda Police Department asked the Florida State Attorney’s Office to bring wiretapping charges against someone who had been caught filming inside the city hall building. The State Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute, explaining in <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5727926-Florida-State-Attorney-s-Office-disposition-notice.html"">a felony warrant request disposition notice</a> that “a citizen’s right to film government officials, in the discharge of their duties in a public place is a basic, vital, and well-established liberty safeguarded by the First Amendment.”</p><p>The constitutionality of the city ordinance has never been tested in court.</p><p>Mickey Osterreicher, the general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association, told Freedom of the Press Foundation that the City of Punta Gorda may have violated Sheets’ First Amendment rights when it issued the trespass warning.</p><p>“Aside from being based upon a constitutionally suspect ordinance, the trespass notice issued to Mr. Sheets is a blatant violation of his First Amendment rights and chills his ability to gather and disseminate information on important matter of public concern,” Osterreicher said.</p><p>Melissa Reichert, a spokeswoman for the city, <a href=""https://www.yoursun.com/charlotte/news/illegally-barred-from-punta-gorda-city-hall/article_95b6df26-151c-11e9-a574-e7cecdfe4833.html"">told The Port Charlotte Sun</a>, a local newspaper, that the city believes the ordinance is valid and will continue to enforce it.</p><p>“The city has enforced Ordinance 1872-17 as provided therein since its adoption in May 2017,” Reichert told the paper. “Unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise, the city staff believes the ordinance is valid.”</p><p><i>The</i> <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""><i>U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</i></a><i> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

The Express was one of 12 newspapers owned by the media company CNHI to receive such a threat that day.<br/></p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has documented that at least 27 U.S. media outlets were targeted with the hoax bomb threats, alongside hundreds of schools, businesses and public buildings across the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In addition to the CNHI (formerly Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.) papers, eight stations owned by Gray TV and two newspapers owned by McClatchy received the email threats. More may have received the email hoax and not publicized it. <br/></p><p>“When I first received [the email],” Maxwell told the Tracker, “I read it a couple of times and I thought, ‘Oh, this is just a scam.’” But, because of previous incidents over the past 15 years, she said, they now take any kind of threat seriously.<br/></p><p>After consulting with the chief of police, the Express did not evacuate. Neither did the staff at the Joplin Globe in Joplin, Missouri. When reporters Debby Woodin and Emily Younker each received the threatening email, they brought it to Globe Editor Carol Stark and the publisher, who immediately called the police. While the Globe has policies in place for tornadoes and fires, Stark told the Tracker, on the day they received the threat they lacked a clear procedure to follow. <br/></p><p>“We did not evacuate because the police really thought it was a bogus call, but in hindsight now we should have,” she said.<br/></p><p>Events over the past year have spurred many newsrooms across the country to reevaluate their security infrastructure and procedures, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/panic-buttons-cameras-and-gun-under-desk-local-newsrooms-update-security-wake-capital-gazette-attack/"">editors and publishers told the Tracker</a>, and none more so than the June shooting at a newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. On June 28, Jarrod Ramos entered the Capital Gazette offices and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/man-upset-newspaper-coverage-shoots-and-kills-multiple-journalists-capital-gazette-newsroom/"">shot to death five people</a>, including four journalists and a sales associate.<br/></p><p>Andy Bernhard, publisher for The Park Record in Park City, Utah, said that when his newsroom received the bomb threat they were already in the process of following through with recommendations from the county sheriff for improvements to the office’s physical security.<br/></p><p>“It was actually the Annapolis Capital incident that got us moving on evolving our security procedures,” he said. “We’re actively receiving quotes for specifically that: shatterproof glass, keycard entry and new security cameras.”<br/></p><p>Media companies, including CNHI and Swift Communications, have also initiated security reviews and updates in the wake of the Annapolis shooting, including conducting active shooter training with the full staff at each of their outlets.<br/></p><p>On July 10, McClatchy sent an internal email, shared with the Tracker, informing its newsrooms that all locations would have hostile intruder trainings and that it was evaluating and updating the emergency plans and physical security of all locations. The email stated: “These upgrades may include installing panic buttons, remote entry maglocks, video cameras in entryways, shatter-resistant film coating to windows and additional on-site security guards.” <br/></p><p>Jeanne Segal, McClatchy communications director, told the Tracker that all trainings and physical upgrades have been completed.<br/></p><p>Al Lancaster, VP general manager at WSAW-TV in Wausau, Wisconsin, was glad that the threat came in in the middle of the day, when four department heads were in the newsroom and able to clear the building in fewer than 10 minutes. Lancaster told the Tracker, “It was pretty clear that we should evacuate whether we thought the threat was legitimate or not.”<br/></p><p>Lancaster said that the bomb hoax checked their preparedness for such an event.<br/></p><p>“We did just pull our disaster plan which had not been updated for a while,” Lancaster said, “And because of that bomb scare actually we’re looking at it with our department heads and revising and tweaking some things.”<br/></p><p>In a year that saw an increase of violence and threats against journalists, this single-day email bomb hoax tested security procedures and trainings that newsrooms across the country have undertaken. </p></div></div>

Facebook post reads as follows:  “If you Democrats don’t stop this 
conspiracy shit I’m gonna blow your fucking library up”.  Intelligence 
detectives were immediately notified and also the FBI Joint Terrorism

 Terroristic Threat F/3 Charge will be filed for the Dallas City Library
 and a Misdemeanor class A charge will be filed for the threat made 
against an employee of D Magazine.  A DPD CAD Bolo was entered on the 
suspect for situational awareness.  An information bulletin was also 
disseminated by Fusion to all DPD officers. On

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Although
 Anderson’s email, which the councilman forwarded to Brown, stated that 
charges would be filed against Taylor, no charges were ever filed. <br/></p><p>On Nov. 26, shortly after Brown <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1067138293895229440"">tweeted out excerpts</a> of Anderson’s email, D Magazine <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20181127024137/https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2018/11/bomb-threat-made-against-d-magazine-and-j-erik-jonsson-library/"">published a post</a>
 about the bomb threat. A few days later, the post was abruptly deleted 
without any explanation. Rogers told the Tracker that he could not 
comment on what had happened.</p><p>For months, Brown continued to try to get more information about the police investigation. On Dec. 5, he <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1070352725651660803"">spoke at a city council meeting</a>
 and asked the mayor to explain why he had never been notified about the
 bomb threat. On Feb. 24, 2019, he sent assistant police chief Anderson 
copies of more evidence he had dug up on Taylor — screenshots of 
Facebook messages that Taylor had sent to Brown’s girlfriend asking 
about him, and photos from Taylor’s Instagram page that shows him posing
 with a gun. He also <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1099472077994844163"">posted the photos and screenshots</a> on Facebook and Twitter. In response, a former DPD officer <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrettBrown_/status/1099622048094134273"">left a comment</a> saying that Brown “has a smug, punchable face.”</p><p>On
 Feb. 26, Brown spoke with Sheldon Smith, a DPD sergeant overseeing the 
investigation, about the current status of the case. In the 
conversation, which Brown recorded, Smith told Brown that the DPD 
investigated the bomb threats against the Dallas library and D Magazine,
 but ultimately determined that there was not enough evidence to charge 
Taylor.</p><p>“Initially,
 we believed that we would have enough information to file those charges
 on the individual that we’re talking about, just based on the 
preliminary information,” Smith told Brown, according to a recording of 
the conversation. “But after we conducted a thorough investigation, we 
didn't have the elements needed in order to actually file the offense 
for that.”</p><p>Smith
 offered two explanations for why charges could not be brought against 
Taylor. First, he said, Taylor had never said that he would personally 
blow up D Magazine’s building, just that “someone” could.</p><p>“He
 didn’t say that he would,” Smith said, according to the recording. “And
 the element we needed was if he had said, ‘I’m going to blow the 
building up.’ But when he said ‘someone,’ that’s why we couldn’t 
physically charge him.”</p><p>Brown
 pointed out that this explanation couldn’t account for the decision not
 to charge him for the bomb threat against the Dallas library, which 
contains the explicit statement, “I’m gonna blow your fucking library 
up.”</p><p>To
 that, Smith offered a second explanation for not charging Taylor. The 
problem, he said, was that the police could not be sure that Taylor was 
actually responsible for the threat posted from his Facebook account.</p><p>“We
 did extensive research on his Facebook account and we could not confirm
 that it was actually him that said that,” Smith said, according to the 
recording. “It may have been him, but we weren’t 100 percent sure that 
it was him. It would be as if you left your phone sitting on the counter
 and someone’s gonna send messages from your number.”</p><p>Brown
 is an independent journalist, essayist, and media critic who is best 
known for his close association with the online movement Anonymous. 
Although Brown is not a computer hacker, he embedded himself as a 
journalist with a hacker collective tied to Anonymous. In 2012, as 
federal authorities stepped up operations against the hacking group, the
 FBI raided Brown’s house and his mother’s house.</p><p>Later that year, <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2012/09/barret-brown-raid/"">Brown was arrested</a>
 for allegedly threatening one of the FBI agents who had raided his 
mother’s house. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted Brown on a number
 of charges related to trafficking in stolen information, for allegedly 
linking to information that hackers had already stolen. Most of the 
federal charges <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2014/03/barrett-brown-motion-to-dismiss/"">were later dropped</a>, and Brown ultimately <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2014/04/barrett-brown-plea-agreement/"">accepted a plea deal</a> and was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/22/barrett-brown-trial-warns-dangerous-precedent-hacking-sentencing"">sentenced to five years in prison</a>.

Only they would attack the President for not supporting a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters over the course of 1.5 hours including several from the reporter in question. The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it‘s an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration.</p><p>As a result of today’s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.</p></div>

King fairly,” she said. “This decision is unfortunate because it not only shuts out the Des Moines Register reporter, but also the people of Iowa.”</p><p>Other reporters, like Chris Mathias of HuffPost, did not receive a response to an email request for press credentials. On the night of the election, Mathias went to King’s party to cover it.</p><p>“When Jeff King spotted me, he told me to leave,&quot; he told Freedom of the Press Foundation. &quot;When I asked why, he told me to check my email, and just minutes before I had just received an email saying that I wasn’t allowed in and that I should refer to the statement given to the Des Moines register about not letting leftist propaganda outlets in.&quot;</p><p>The reporters banned from covering the election night party had a history of reporting critically on King’s campaign.

After the Standard went ahead and published it, Jeff King — who had previously told Rubenstein that he could cover the election-night event — pulled Rubenstein&#x27;s press credentials.</p><p>Rubenstein wrote in a Nov. 13 editorial for the New York Times that it was his critical reporting that got him banned from the party.</p><p>“Mr. King will insist that his opposition to the press is political — as in, the press is all left-wing propaganda,” he wrote. “In fact, it’s part of his calculated assault on truth and the ability to determine it. His idea of how the press is supposed to function would be right at home in the Gaza Strip, Iran or Turkey. Favorable coverage gets you open access. Dare to criticize and you are denied.”</p><p>HuffPost&#x27;s Mathias is concerned about the precedent of retaliatory denial of access that King is setting for other representatives. </p><p>“People like Steve King are picking up on Trump’s messaging about the press being the enemy of the people, and King has decided to part in it,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s a worrying trend if more representatives start to embrace the fake news smear.&quot;</p></div></div>","The congressman's son said that campaign views the Register as ""leftist propaganda""",None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,Steve King

Four days later, he rescinded the order and unsealed the search warrant materials.</p><p>The search warrant was executed in January 2018 against Grant Robicheaux, a prominent surgeon suspected of sexually assaulting multiple women. Like most search warrants in California, it was initially filed under seal but was automatically unsealed and made available to the public shortly after it was carried out.</p><p>Eight months later, in September 2018, police arrested Robicheaux and his girlfriend, Cerissa Riley, and the Orange County district attorney Tony Rackauckas charged them with sexually assaulting two women. After the arrests were announced, a number of journalists found the January search warrant materials (which were now available to the public) and reported on their contents. In response, both prosecutors and Robicheaux’s defense team asked a judge to re-seal the search warrant materials, which he did.</p><p>The next month, as the Associated Press reported, Rackauckas announced that five more women had accused Robicheaux and Riley of sexual assault. At a court hearing on Oct. 17, Rackauckas’ office formally filed additional charges against Robicheaux and Riley, who pleaded not guilty.</p><p>According to the OC Register, outside the hearing, Orange County supervisor Todd Spitzer — who is challenging Rackauckas in the election for Orange County district attorney — held a press conference to criticize Rackauckas for taking so long to arrest Robicheaux and RIley. Speaking to a group of reporters, Spitzer said Rackauckas should have had Robicheaux and Riley arrested back in January 2018, right after the search warrant was executed. To prove his point, Spitzer and his assistant handed out copies of the January 2018 search warrant materials to reporters.</p><p>Rackauckas objected to Spitzer’s stunt, since the search warrant materials were supposed to be sealed from the public, and the district attorney’s office asked judge Jones do something about it. (Jones was not the judge who originally ordered the search warrant sealed, but he was the judge presiding over the hearing.)</p><p>Jones called reporters back into the courtroom and told them to return the copies of the search warrants that they had received. He then told them to remind their news organizations that the search warrant was sealed and they should not publish it.</p><p>The Orange County Register and the AP challenged judge Jones’ order, arguing that it amounted to an unconstitutional prior restraint on the press. On Oct. 21, Jones unsealed the search warrant, finding that it could not be re-sealed once it had already been made available to the public.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/judge-gavel-1461291406zfK.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

After questioning Siegel, judge Gaughan ordered that he be held in &quot;direct criminal contempt&quot; for violating the judge&#x27;s earlier decorum order. Gaughan&#x27;s decorum order allowed a defined media pool to record the trial proceedings and then share the footage with other journalists, but prohibited individual journalists (like Siegel) from recording parts of the trial on their own. Siegel was removed from court and taken to jail.</p><p>Video recorded by ABC 7 (which was allowed to film the proceedings) shows Gaughan questioning Siegel.</p></div></div>

Sztraicher ordered journalists not to publish images taken during the arraignment hearing of Ramon Escobar, who was charged with the murders of multiple homeless people in Southern California.</p><p>According to court documents, Sztraicher gave permission to journalists from The Los Angeles Times, The Associated Press and a television news station to document the proceedings after hearing no objections. However, once reporters began taking photographs, an attorney for Escobar raised an objection, citing an “identification issue.”</p><p>Although photographs of Escobar had already been released and published by media outlets, the objection was sustained by Sztraicher, who then ordered reporters to stop taking photos and video. He also ordered a sketch artist to stop drawing.</p><p>Dan Laidman, an attorney representing The Times and the AP, provided documents that show the journalists were unsure if the court had simply halted further photography or had prohibited publishing images already taken. Journalists, including Times reporters Gina Ferazzi and James Queally, asked the judge for further instruction.</p><p>“When journalists pressed for clarification, the judge ruled that the publication of any images, videos or sketches of Escobar from the court hearing would be considered a violation of a court order,” <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-escobar-photo-20180926-story.html"">The Times reported</a>.</p><p>At a hearing the following day, Laidman argued the order was “flatly unconstitutional” and asked that it be vacated, noting the Supreme Court has never upheld a prior restraint.</p><p>“The Times understands that this Court issued its prior restraint because of concerns about an unspecified ‘identification’ issue concerning Defendant, and out of concern for his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. But these interests simply do not justify a prior restraint here,” Laidman wrote in the court brief. “The September 26 Order is at odds with the basic purpose of the First Amendment - namely, to prevent the government from imposing prior restraints against the press. […] The Times, therefore, respectfully requests that the Court vacate the Order immediately.”</p><p>Escobar’s attorney argued that because Sztraicher’s permission was granted verbally and not through written order, the photographs were obtained unlawfully.</p><p>Sztraicher denied this argument, acknowledging journalists had obtained prior verbal approval, and vacated his order.</p><p>“Defense attorneys often argue that publishing their client’s image before trial could improperly sway witnesses, … Once photographs have been taken legally, however, a judgeccccccjfk typically can’t bar news outlets from publishing them,” <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-escobar-photo-hearing-20180927-story.html"">The Times reported</a> following the hearing.</p><p>The AP also published on the successful free speech defense.</p><p>“The order should never have been issued in the first place,” David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, <a href=""https://apnews.com/564a8911b89d4f3d819aee6846c896bb"">told the AP</a>. “I’m glad the court saw the light of day.”</p><p>In a statement emailed to the Freedom of the Press Foundation about the decision, The Times’ Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine noted how the judge’s courtroom ruling put the news outlet in a difficult position.</p><p>“It is distressing that once again the Los Angeles Times needs to resort to litigation to preserve our rights under the 1st Amendment,” Pearlstine said.</p><p>Earlier in the year, The Times filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals to rescind a restraining order against publishing information made public in the criminal case of former narcotics detective John Balian.

Although some of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya River Basin property have given the company permission to build the pipeline, hundreds of others have refused to do so. Despite this, the company had already begun making alterations to the land, including removing trees and digging a ditch. It has also asked the state of Louisiana to use eminent domain to seize the land from the co-owners who object to the pipeline.</p><p>Savage told Freedom of the Press Foundation that one of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya Basin land who is resisting the pipeline had given her permission to be on the property.</p><p>“Some were actively resisting, and I had a letter from a landowner saying we were welcome to be on the property,&quot; she said. &quot;For people to visit the property, you only need permission from one landowner.”</p><p>Savage had previously been arrested for trespassing while reporting on the pipeline protests on Aug. 18. Once she was released on bail, she returned to the resistance camp at the Atchafalaya River Basin to continue covering the protest movement.</p><p>Savage said that on September 3 and 4, she witnessed law enforcement officers treated protesters badly.</p><p>“They chased them, tackled them, and allowed pipeline security employees to put their hands on protesters,&quot; she said. &quot;It was heavily violence and I got some pictures of law enforcement chasing them.”</p><p>She said that a few weeks later, on Sept. 17, she was riding in a vehicle that was pulled over in a different parish in Louisiana. The officers ran the ID&#x27;s of everyone in the car, but everything came back fine and they were allowed to proceed after receiving a citation.</p><p>The next day, sheriff&#x27;s deputies claimed that Savage had an outstanding warrant dating from Sept. 3.</p><p>Savage said that on September 18, she was tipped off by protesters to come to a particular part of the swamp, and when she pulled up in her boat to the ramp, she saw sheriff’s department officers present. As Savage began photographing the scene, the officers came to her and arrested her, allegedly on an outstanding warrant.</p><p>“They said they were arresting me for an outstanding warrant,” she said. “But I knew there was nothing out for me.”</p><p>Savage said that an individual who witnessed the arrest called the sheriff’s department to inquire why she was arrested and learned that there was no warrant out for her.</p><p>Savage was arrested under Louisiana&#x27;s newly-enacted state law against &quot;unauthorized entry of a critical infrastructure project.&quot; The Louisiana state law — which only went into effect on Aug. 1 — makes trespassing on a &quot;critical infrastructure project&quot; like an oil pipeline a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.</p><p>She had previously been arrested under the same law on Aug. 18.</p><p>Savage contrasted her treatment by the sheriff’s department to her previous arrest while covering the protest in August. Then, she said, the arrest wasn’t violent. But this time, she said the officers grabbed her roughly and pulled her hands back.</p><p>&quot;They really hurt me arms, shoulders, and wrists,&quot; she said. &quot;It was really unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>She said that the officers put her in the back of a police car and then drove her around for about an hour, which she found suspicious.</p><p>&quot;It’s a 20 minute drive to the station,&quot; she said. &quot;But they kept driving around through sugar cane fields, and I had no idea where he was taking me. I thought maybe it was intimidation because they didn’t actually have a warrant.&quot;</p><p>The St. Martin’s Sheriff Department did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>Savage said that, despite her two arrests, the local district attorney has not brought any criminal charges against her.</p><p>“I’m doubtful that they ever will,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a very clear intimidation tactic to stop me from covering the story.”</p><p>“I will go back,” she added. “I’m not going to let them intimidate me. It’s our job to hold these officials accountable.”</p></div></div>",Savage was also arrested while covering anti-pipeline protests in August 2018.,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/image.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>Freelance journalist Karen Savage is arrested by sheriff&#x27;s deputies while covering anti-pipeline protests in Louisiana, on September 18, 2018.</p>",arrested and released,not charged,None,None,True,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"Bayou Bridge pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, pipeline, protest",,,,,,

At the time, Savage was on assignment for The Appeal, a progressive news site focused on criminal justice issues.</p><p>Savage was embedded with a camp of protesters, known as water protectors, who were aiming to defend a piece of land in Louisiana’s Atchafalaya River Basin, a wetlands area co-owned by hundreds of people. Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, is trying to build its new Bayou Bridge oil pipeline through the area. Although some of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya Basin property have given the company permission to build the pipeline, hundreds of others have refused to do so. Despite this, the company had already begun making alterations to the land, including removing trees and digging a ditch. It has also asked the state of Louisiana to use eminent domain to seize the land from the co-owners who object to the pipeline.</p><p>Savage told Freedom of the Press Foundation that one of the co-owners of the Atchafalaya Basin land who is resisting the pipeline had given her permission to be on the property.</p><p>“Some were actively resisting, and I had a letter from a landowner saying we were welcome to be on the property,&quot; she said. &quot;For people to visit the property, you only need permission from one landowner.”</p><p>On Aug. 18, Savage was with three water protectors, taking pictures and reporting, when she was arrested by sheriff&#x27;s deputies from the nearby St. Martin Parish.</p><p>“I wasn’t even on the contested part of the land,” she said. “Sheriff’s deputies showed up and said I had to leave. I said I had permission to be there. I didn’t think I, or anyone else, would be arrested.”</p><p>She showed the officer a photograph of letter she had from a landowner, granting her permission to remain on the property. She said that she urged the officer to call the landowner, but he declined to do so. Officers then arrested her and the three water protectors who were with her.</p><p>Savage was one of the first people to be arrested under a newly-enacted Louisiana state law against &quot;unauthorized entry of a critical infrastructure project,&quot; which went into effect on Aug. 1. The new Louisiana state law makes trespassing on a &quot;critical infrastructure project&quot; like an oil pipeline a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. (Trespassing on land that is not a &quot;critical infrastructure project&quot; remains a misdemeanor.)</p><p>Although Savage was arrested under the law, the local district attorney has not yet brought any criminal charges against her.</p><p>After Savage was released on bail, she returned to the area to continue reporting on the protests against the Bayou Bridge pipeline.</p><p>“I bonded out, and kept reporting,” she said. “I wasn’t going to be intimidated.”</p><p>She later published a piece in The Appeal about her arrest and the way that Energy Transfer Partners employs off-duty law enforcement officers as a private security force, which works closely with uniformed St. Martin Parish sheriff&#x27;s deputies to arrest pipeline protesters.</p><p>The St. Martin’s Sheriff Department did not respond to request for comment.</p></div></div>",,None,None,,arrested and released,not charged,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"Bayou Bridge pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, pipeline, protest",,,,,,

Ruttle tried to photograph a group of approximately 20 white nationalists, who emerged from the Foggy Bottom metro station and were soon surrounded by Metropolitan Police Department officers. </p><p>“The scene was chaotic,” Ruttle told Freedom of the Press Foundation, describing the way that police officers on bicycles and motorcycles formed a “protective envelope” around the group.</p><p>Ruttle said that while he followed the marchers, he saw a police officer in front of him tip his bicycle over. Instinctively, Ruttle reached out to help the officer.</p><p>“He was having trouble getting back on,” Ruttle said. “To be honest, I’m not sure what was going through my mind, but if someone falls over, I try to reach for them, whether they’re a cop or activist or anyone else.”</p><p>Ruttle put his hand on the officer’s back and asked the officer if he was okay. That’s when he spotted another officer running toward him.</p><p>“For a split second I saw him running at me at what appeared to be full speed, and then he crashed into me,” Ruttle said. “Getting hit by a bulletproof vest is a hard service. I’ve been hit and shoved before, but that was like a football block. I saw black for a split second.”</p><p>“He got me in the chin real hard,” he added.</p><p>Although the impact rattled him, Ruttle remained on his feet. He said that he gave the officer who hit him some “choice words” and then explained that he was trying to assist the officer who had fallen off his bike. Ruttle said that the officer who hit him just walked backwards, pointed at him, and told him not to “do that again.” Then the officer disappeared.</p><p>At the time he was hit, Ruttle said, he was carrying three cameras and wearing his press credentials. </p><p>Ruttle said that he was able to continue his work documenting the rest of the rally, but his jaw remained sore sore for a week after the incident.</p><p>Ruttle has not been able to get anyone from the MPD to explain why an officer charged at him and hit him in the chin.</p><p>“I tried to engage with [the officer] later in the march, and he refused to make eye contact,” Ruttle said. “The only thing I can say is that he either thought I was trying to push his fellow officer to the ground, or he didn’t like that I had a hand on him.”</p><p>Ruttle said that he called the MPD&#x27;s public relations division in an attempt to understand what happened. Although the department took down his name and number, and promised to call him back, he said that he has not received any further communication from the MPD.</p><p>The MPD did not respond to a request for comment from Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p><p>Ruttle said the police officers at the Unite the Right II rally used aggressive tactics and seemed to have a “low tolerance threshold.”</p><p>“The cops put a group in the front, and they were being very aggressive,” he said. “You’d stop to take a picture, and backwalk, and it was never fast enough. I would try to take some pictures and they would push me, and as I’d walk further away to give them space, they&#x27;d shove me more. I got most of my shoves from the back. I was really impressed at how aggressive they were.”</p><p>Ruttle noted that freelance journalists in particular have to make difficult decisions about how far they are willing to for their reporting: “Is this day important enough for me as a freelance journalist to find myself in jail with no support? And have to deal with the legal system? Is it worth me risking getting hurt?”</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,law enforcement,no,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"protest, white nationalist protest",,,,,,

He began filming the aftermath of the crash; some of his video footage was later included in a local TV station’s report on the crash.</p><p>After a maintenance worker spotted Weaver and alerted the Illinois State Police, an ISP trooper approached Weaver and arrested him. The trooper, Kyle Fletcher, was familiar with Weaver from previous incidents.</p><p>“I realized that this was an individual that I had spoken to before,” Fletcher wrote in a field report documenting the arrest. “I once again asked Weaver what he was doing illegally parked on the shoulder of the tollways and walking around on a road where pedestrians are forbidden. … Due to the fact that this was not the first time I had spoke[n] to Weaver about this sort of behavior he was placed under arrest for criminal trespass to property.”</p><p>Weaver said that Fletcher also ticketed him.</p><p>“This trooper also charged me with three tickets,” he said. “One for stopping on the shoulder, which he considered a crime because I was not using the Tollway for its intended purpose.

MPD officers then arrested him and took him to an interrogation room, where Mendez said detectives pressured him to answer questions without an attorney present and to delete three of his photographs.</p><p>In an interview with Freedom of the Press Foundation, Mendez said he was preparing for the publication of a big piece on the local police department’s emergency response times. When Mendez’s editor asked him to get a photo to accompany the piece, he decided to stop by a police station near his house and take some pictures of MPD squad cars lined up in the parking lot.</p><p>Mendez drove into the parking lot and started taking photos of the MPD cars in the parking lot. When he spotted a police officer in civilian clothes with a badge around his neck, he said he waved and explained that he was a reporter taking photos for a story. The officer waved back as he walked to his car.</p><p>Mendez said he also noticed a uniformed MPD officer walking through the parking lot toward a police wagon. The uniformed officer did not wave back to Mendez.</p><p>After Mendez finished taking photos and left the lot, he saw that the police wagon was following him.</p><p>“I drove about two blocks away,” he told Freedom of the Press Foundation. “I noticed in my rearview that there was a paddy wagon. It followed me for about four more blocks and then pulled me over. He came up to my window and asked me what I was doing in the lot.”</p><p>When Mendez identified himself as a journalist and explained that he was taking photographs for a news story, the officer asked him if he had seen the “no trespassing” sign next the police station parking lot. Mendez said that he had not, but he would have obeyed it if he had seen it. According to Mendez, the officer took Mendez’s ID and returned to the police van to run it. In the meantime, Mendez texted his editor to let her know that he had been pulled over.</p><p>As Mendez waited for the officer to return his ID, an MPD squad car pulled up next to the police van. Once the officer from the squad car spoke with the officer from the police van, both officers approached Mendez and told him to exit his vehicle.</p><p>“They said, ‘well I’m going to have to give you a ticket for trespassing, and I’m going to need to cuff you and take you back to the station,’” Mendez recalled, adding that the officers insisted on placing him under arrest instead of just writing him a ticket on the spot.</p><p>“I just told them that I was a reporter and they could verify that, and I didn’t know that there was a no trespassing sign.”</p><p>At the police station, Mendez said he was asked about his medical and criminal history before being led into an interrogation room for further questioning.</p><p>Although Mendez said that he felt that he perhaps needed a lawyer, he said a detective made him feel that he was being overly defensive.</p><p>“They made it seem that if I had requested a lawyer, I wasn’t going to get to leave and they would probably transfer me to county jail,” he said.</p><p>The detective, according to Mendez, asked him about his family, including details about his parents’ ages and addresses, and accused him of defying an order. Mendez said that he continued to repeat that he was a reporter, and had written about the Milwaukee police department multiple times.</p><p>“He asked me kind of casually: ‘what’s your story about?’ I said, I don’t feel comfortable telling you that.”</p><p>Mendez said that the detective asked to see the photographs he took, and threatened to confiscate his camera as evidence if he did not comply.</p><p>“By then, I was just giving up.”</p><p>Going through the photographs, Mendez recalled, the detective pointed out three that were “not fine” and ordered Mendez to erase them. He complied, and was later released.</p><p>On Dec. 3, Mendez <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/12/03/milwaukee-reporter-cleared-trespassing-police-station/2196438002/"">was found not guilty of trespassing charges</a>. A judge did find that he had parked in violation of the law, and he must pay a $50 fine.</p><p>“I wondered afterwards if what happened to me was because of my brown skin, or because I was a reporter writing about the MPD,” <a href=""https://milwaukeenns.org/2018/12/03/not-guilty-ruling-doesnt-make-things-all-right-not-even-close/"">Mendez wrote in a first-person account of the incident for the Neighborhood News Service</a>. “You have to remember that my arrest occurred at a time when President Trump had attacked people of Hispanic descent, repeatedly declared that all the news he didn’t agree with was “fake news,” and begun to call the press the “enemy of the people,” a sentiment he continues to espouse.”</p><p>The Neighborhood News Service is considering filing a complaint with MPD.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve been told we couldn&#x27;t cover a meeting, that kind of thing, but never someone arrested and interrogated&quot; over their work as a reporter,” <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/12/03/milwaukee-reporter-cleared-trespassing-police-station/2196438002/"">Neighborhood News Service editor Sharon McGowan told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>. “It was outrageous the way he was treated.”</p><p>Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/EdgarMendez.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,arrested and released,charges dropped,None,None,False,None,None,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,trespassing,,,,

The Times plans to challenge the order.&quot;</p><p>Times publisher Norm Pearlstine defended the Times&#x27; decision to report on the plea deal. </p><p>“We believe that once material is in the public record, it is proper and appropriate to publish it if it is newsworthy,” Times publisher Norm Pearlstine said in an interview with the paper.</p><p>The temporary restraining order will remain in effect until Walter rules on whether or not to grant Balian a preliminary injunction — which is similar to a temporary restraining order, but more permanent — against the Times.</p><p>On July 16, the Times filed an emergency petition for a writ of mandamus with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over federal district courts in California. The petition, which was filed under seal, essentially asks the appeals court to step in and order the district court to immediately rescind the temporary restraining order.</p><p>A coalition of 60 news and press freedom organizations, led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press, submitted a letter to the Ninth Circuit in support of the Times&#x27; petition.</p><p>&quot;It appears that the district court may have entered the temporary restraining order in an attempt to correct the mistaken public filing of the plea agreement, which was meant to be kept under seal,&quot; the letter states. &quot;The district court&#x27;s desire to correct this <i>administrative</i> error, however, cannot justify the imposition of a prior restraint, which has now created a <i>constitutional</i> harm. Although courts have the power to enter sealing orders when common law and constitutional standards are met ... once information is made public, nearly 90 years of constitutional law stand in the way of using prior restraints to prevent a newspaper from communicating the information to its readers.&quot;</p></div></div>","On July 17, the judge vacated the order, freeing the Times to write about the plea deal.",https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2018-07-16_at_1.59.28.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,dropped,Los Angeles Times,,,,,,,

There is no love lost between Lee and UNCA. Lee joined UNCA shortly after he began covering the UN in 2005, but left the association on bad terms in 2012 after reporting on a potential conflict of interest involving UNCA’s then-president.</p><p>The UNCA meeting was held on Jan. 29, 2016, in the UN media briefing room, which is open to all accredited journalists at the United Nations. Although UNCA wanted to use the briefing room to hold a members-only meeting, Lee insisted that he had the right to stay in the briefing room and even to livestream the meeting. UNCA complained to UN staff, who eventually cajoled Lee to leave.</p><p>In the aftermath of that incident, the UN stripped Lee of his “resident correspondent” status, making him a non-resident correspondent. Lee lost his office and his carte blanche access to the UN headquarters building.</p><p>According to the United Nations Media Guidelines, non-resident correspondents are generally not allowed to be in the UN building after 7 p.m.:</p></div></div>

The meeting was not open to the public or press, so Lee had “staked out” the meeting, waiting outside of the room to speak with attendees as they entered or exited the meeting room. Around 10 p.m., he conducted a brief interview with Tommo Monthé, a Cameroonian diplomat who chairs the budget committee, and then headed over to a café area to type up his interview notes.</p><p>According to Lee, he was typing up his interview notes in the café when two UN security guards approached him and grabbed him, ordering him to leave the premises. Lee refused, insisting that he had the right to be in the building because he was a journalist covering a meeting. The altercation with the guards left Lee with a ripped shirt and an injured arm.</p><p>As Lee was being escorted outside, he spoke to Christian Saunders, an assistant secretary general. Lee livestreamed his conversation with Saunders and later uploaded portions of it to YouTube.</p></div></div>

Is that OK with you?”</p><p>“The budget hearings are the propriety of member states, and it’s a closed budget hearing,” Saunders says.</p><p>Lee refuses to leave, arguing that he has the right as a journalist to stand outside of the budget meeting and interview diplomats, while Saunders repeatedly tells Lee that he needs to obey the security guards’ orders to leave.</p><p>Lee, who appears to be very shaken up by the altercation, repeatedly refers to the security guards as “thugs” and criticizes them for using physical force against him.</p><p>“Seriously! I was sitting there typing,” he says to one of the security guards as they escort him out of the building. “You really have to push my neck, right? Something is wrong with you. You should be fired. If you were in the NYPD, you would be fired right now because I’m not resisting. You had no right to touch my computer. You had no right to tear my shirt!”</p><p>On July 4, the day after Lee was removed from the building, he filed a police report against the UN for assault.</p><p>On July 5, the UN suspended his press credentials, pending the conclusion of an investigation into his behavior. Without UN press credentials, Lee was not allowed entrance into the UN headquarters building. Instead, he had to cover the UN from a bus stop across the street.</p><p>Although the investigation initially focused on the July 3 incident, but it soon expanded into a more general review of Lee’s behavior and professionalism. The review considered numerous complaints made about Lee’s behavior by UN member states, UN staff, and Lee’s fellow UN correspondents. Lee was not given any opportunity to respond to any of the complaints against him.</p><p>On Aug. 17, the UN notified Lee in a letter that it had concluded its review and decided to withdraw his press accreditation.</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Lee believes that the UN leadership is retaliating against him because he has reported on their apparent conflicts of interest and corruption. The UN, for its part, says that it objects only to Lee’s behavior, not his reporting.</p><p>“Just like the White House, access is not a right, it’s a privilege,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Columbia Journalism Review. “None of this is happening now because of what he writes. … He creates an atmosphere of incivility within our working environment.”</p><p>But it is difficult to separate Lee’s behavior from his reporting. He is an aggressive reporter, in every sense of the word. He is dedicated to exposing the corruption and conflicts of interest that he believes permeate the UN, and he has little patience for those who refuse to talk to him. Although his breathless posts on Inner City Press and his commentary-filled livestreams may often seem hyperbolic and conspiratorial, Lee has done important investigative journalism on some of the unsavory influence-peddling that underlies diplomacy at the UN.</p><p>In particular, he has reported on the UN’s close relationships with unsavory regimes in places like Cameroon, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Recently, Lee has reported that the UN leadership has soft-pedaled criticism of Cameroon’s human rights abuses at the same time that it has tried to win budgetary concessions from the Cameroonian diplomat who chairs the UN budget committee. That is the reason that he was covering the budget meeting late at night on July 3, which led to him being forcibly escorted out of the building.</p><p>Lee has suggested that the UN roughed him up and expelled him from the UN building on July 3 as part of a conspiracy to stop him from reporting on the UN’s relationship with Cameroon. It’s more likely that Lee was ordered to leave the building because it was after 7 p.m. and he was a non-resident correspondent. Still, whether intentional or not, the UN&#x27;s actions have had the effect of making it more difficult for Lee to report on conflicts of interest at the UN.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/matthewlee-expel.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private security,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,United Nations

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Jarrod Ramos, the suspect in the shooting, had threatened and harassed Capital Gazette staffers for years, according to the Sun.</p><p>It began in July 2011, when Capital columnist Eric Hartley wrote about how Ramos was charged with harassment after stalking and threatening a high school classmate online. In response to Hartley&#x27;s column, Ramos waged a one-man war against him and the paper. (Hartley has since left The Capital for The Virginian-Pilot, and Marquardt has retired.)</p><p>In July 2012, he filed a defamation lawsuit against Hartley, Capital Gazette Communications, and The Capital editor and publisher Tom Marquardt. Ramos represented himself in the suit, which was filed in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. At a March 2013 court hearing, a judge dismissed Ramos&#x27; complaint with prejudice and tried to explain to Ramos why the article was not defamatory:</p></div></div>

It reveals a fundamental failure to understand what defamation law is and, more particularly, what defamation law is not. The appellant is aggrieved because the newspaper story about his guilty plea assumed that he was guilty and that the guilty plea was, therefore, properly accepted. He is aggrieved because the story was sympathetic toward the harassment victim and was not equally understanding of the harassment perpetrator. The appellant wanted equal coverage of his side of the story. He wanted a chance to put the victim in a bad light, in order to justify and explain why he did what he did. That, however, is not the function of defamation law.</p><p>The appellant was charged with a criminal act. The appellant perpetrated a criminal act. The appellant plead guilty to having perpetrated a criminal act. The appellant was punished for his criminal act. He is not entitled to equal sympathy with his victim and may not blithely dismiss her as a &quot;bipolar drunkard.&quot; He does not appear to have learned his lesson.</p></div>

Robles fought the subpoenas, but the New York Court of Appeals — the highest court in the state — upheld the subpoenas on a technicality in a ruling on June 27, 2018. </p><p>If Robles refuses to comply with the subpoena, she could be held in contempt of court and put in jail.</p><p>In October 2013, Robles conducted a jailhouse interview with Conrado Juarez, who had been charged with the murder of “Baby Hope,” a four year old found dead in a picnic cooler in 1991. Although Juarez had confessed to the murder to police, he told Robles that police had coerced him into confessing. The day after the interview, the Times reported that Juarez claimed that his confession to police had been coerced.</p><p>In early 2016, Robles was subpoenaed to testify about her interview with Juarez and to hand over her reporter’s notes from the interview. Robles was subpoenaed to testify at a pre-trial hearing to determine admissibility of Juarez’s statements to law enforcement. </p><p>Robles moved to quash the subpoenas.</p><p>According to the New York State Constitution, a reporter can only be compelled to disclose non-confidential information if it is “critical or necessary” to the case and not available from any other source.</p><p>On April 13, 2016, the court quashed the subpoena, ruling that Robles’ testimony was not “critical or necessary” to the pretrial hearing because the prosecution already had a videotape of Juarez’s confession and access to the police and prosecutor that obtained it. The court also noted that compelling Robles’ testimony would open the door to lines of questioning beyond published material during cross examination.</p><p>After the pretrial hearing, the prosecution tried to subpoena Robles to testify during Juarez’s criminal trial. Robles again moved to quash the subpoenas, but this time, the trial court ruled against her. In August 2016, the trial court formally upheld the subpoenas, ruling that her testimony was “critical or necessary” to the case that the prosecution wanted to make about Juarez’s confession during the trial.</p><p>Robles immediately appealed the trial court’s decision. In October 2016, the First Department appeals court reversed the trial court’s decision, finding that the prosecution had not shown that Robles’ testimony was so “critical or necessary” that it could override her reporter’s privilege not to testify about her sources.</p><p>The prosecution then asked the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New York state, to review the First Department appeals court’s decision, and the New York Court of Appeals agreed to do so. </p><p>The prosecution wanted the New York Court of Appeals to find that Robles’ testimony was in fact “critical or necessary” to the case and the First Department appeals court was wrong to reverse the trial court’s original decision forcing Robles to testify. Robles’ attorneys wanted the New York Court of Appeals to uphold the First Department appeals court’s decision and ensure that journalists in New York state cannot be compelled to testify in court about her conversations with sources. </p><p>“Ms. Roles has testified that most sources in jail would not speak with her if they came to believe ‘that the prosecution could successfully compel [her] to testify’ about their conversations,” Robles’ legal team wrote in a brief to the New York Court of Appeals. “Permitting prosecutors to enforce subpoenas like the one in this case would ‘fundamentally diminish’ Ms. Robles’s ‘practical ability to gather the news…’ and would in turn diminish the public’s knowledge about claims of mistreatment by indigent individuals caught up in the criminal justice system.”</p><p>In the end, the New York Court of Appeals did not rule on whether or not Robles’ testimony was necessary to the case. Instead, in a controversial 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that Robles was not technically allowed to appeal the trial court’s original decision, so the First Department appeals court’s ruling was completely moot.</p><p>The New York Court of Appeals did not actually say that the trial court’s decision to uphold the subpoenas was correct, just that Robles was not allowed to appeal it.</p><p>But it hardly matters to Robles. Since she’s not allowed to appeal the trial court’s decision to uphold the subpoenas ordering to testify, that decision stands.</p><p>If she refuses to testify, the trial court could find her in contempt of court and order her jailed until she agrees to testify.</p><p>The Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press (a partner organization of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) criticized the Court of Appeals decision.</p><p>“The protections of a shield law are meaningless unless a reporter can appeal an erroneous trial court ruling,” RCFP executive director Bruce Brown said in a statement. “Today’s decision leaves important substantive protections for journalists under New York law without the means to enforce them. A reporter should not have to risk going to jail for contempt in order to trigger appellate review of her rights.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['UPHELD'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Kruze said that Kalasho and the dog advanced on him from 40 feet away to within 10 to 12 feet, before he was able to unlock his car door and enter the safety of his vehicle.</p><p>“I proceed to my car and he keeps coming closer to me with the dog and letting the dog lurch at me,” Kruze said in an interview with Freedom of the Press Foundation, adding that he feared Kalasho might release the chain on the dog and let it attack him.</p><p>“This is stuff you go to see horror movies about,” he said.</p><p>During the incident, he said, Kalasho called him a fake journalist and verbally threatened both him and  East County Magazine editor Miriam Raftery. Raftery told Freedom of the Press Foundation that Kruze called her shortly after the incident.</p><p>“When Paul called me, his voice was trembling and he was obviously terrified,” she said. “I was worried about his safety and my own, especially since Paul said Kalasho told him, with the dog snarling lunging toward him, ‘I’m going to take you down and that bitch, Miriam Raftery.'”</p><p>On June 24, the day after the parking lot incident, Kalasho published a Facebook post about Kruze, whom he described as a “deranged psychopath” and “lunatic” who was stalking him.</p><p>“I did research and found that this so called journalist made a Youtube channel whereby most all of his videos are about me,” Kalasho wrote in the post, which was later deleted. “He even posted a video of me training my dog, and other montage videos of me speaking ranging different dates. This infatuation he has with me is creepy to say the least.”</p><p>Kalasho wrote that he had contacted the police and planned to seek a restraining order against the journalist.</p><p>A number of Kalasho’s supporters commented on the Facebook post, expressing concern for the councilman’s safety. Some encouraged Kalasho to use violence against Kruze.</p><p>“You should get your CCW [concealed carry license],” one commenter wrote.</p><p>“Once you become a public figure, you lose most of your rights,” Kalasho replied. “Trust me, had I had a CCW, I would have been on CNN today doing interviews from behind bars.”</p><p>Another supporter published a photo of a gun, accompanied by the text, “I would much rather go my grave never needing my gun, than go there wishing I had it.” Kalasho replied, “#Truth.”</p><p>Kruze said that it was scary to see Kalasho encouraging supporters’ violent threats against him.</p><p>“He just kept on inciting these different followers of his, and then the people started posting,” Kruze said. “There were people saying you should go after this guy. Then they started posting pictures of guns, and then it ended up with another guy who was an optometrist in Ramona, California, suggesting that a .357 caliber bullet be used on me,” Kruze said. “I’ll tell you that finally, that particular post, and the whole Facebook post, it finally hit me. It hit me… All the sudden this is what people talk about for real, and that is damn scary.”</p><p>On July 10, Kalasho went after Kruze again, this time in a Facebook video.</p><p>In the video, Kalasho says that he threatened Kruze with his dog because he thought Kruze might be carrying a weapon.</p><p>“Looking at this person that was approaching my wife and I, like, I don’t know him from Adam,” Kalasho says in the video. “I don’t know if he had a knife, or a gun or anything on him. And every cue and everything that he did lead me to believe that he was going to inflict harm to me or my family. So I used my dog. And anybody listening, watching this just play it through, what’s the alternative? The alternative is having my wife hurt? No, I’d rather my dog maul him, like literally.”</p><p>On July 13, the San Diego Society of Professional Journalists issued a statement, defending the rights of journalists and calling on the El Cajon Police Department to fully investigate the attack:</p></div></div>

The arresting officer hands Nigro’s equipment — camera, phone, and backpack — over to other officers and tells them, “it’s evidence.” The livestream continues for a few minutes after Nigro is arrested, as police search his backpack.</p><p>Nigro said that he was kept in the police van for about an hour and then taken to the police precinct. Nigro said that he was concerned for his safety while riding in the van, since officers never strapped him into his seat.</p><p>“At one point, they started to move the van and I was not tied in,” he said. “The guy leaned back and said, ‘Are you OK?’ I said, ‘Yeah but I’m not strapped in.’ He said, ‘We’re not going anywhere, just moving backward.’ About an hour later, they took me to the precinct but never strapped me in.”</p><p>When he got to the precinct, he said, he was processed and put in a holding cell for about half an hour, before being released on a $545 bail. </p><p>All of Nigro’s equipment — including his iPhone, Canon 5D Mark III camera, two camera lenses (a 24–70mm standard lens and a Sony A7ii 70–200mm zoom lens), and notebook — was returned to him when he was released. He said that it was clear that the police had searched his equipment, though nothing appeared to be damaged and none of the photos on his phone or camera had been deleted.</p><p>Nigro was charged with “failure to obey” and given a ticket to appear in a Jefferson City court at 8:13 a.m. on July 11, 2018.</p><p>The Kansas City Star reported that Nigro was one of 76 people arrested in connection with the June 11 protests, and that everyone arrested was issued a citation that carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail or a $1,000 fine. </p><p>This is not the only time that Nigro was arrested while covering a protest. In 2016, he said, he was arrested by an NYPD officer while documenting an anti-Trump march in New York City.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/nigro_arrest_ff15.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>Police officers in Jefferson City, Missouri, arrest photojournalist Michael Nigro, on June 11, 2018.</p>",arrested and released,charges dropped,None,None,False,None,returned in full,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"Fight for 15, Poor People's Campaign, protest",failure to obey,,,,,

As she is slowly lead away, Harvey told Freedom of the Press Foundation he was shoved and accosted by a stranger who scuffled him against a wall.</p><p>“This guy he’s screaming, he’s screaming, he’s screaming,” Harvey said, “Well, by then why would I even think he’s a cop? I think he’s some lunatic who feels that my coverage of this poor people’s event is incorrect or it’s bringing attention to them that shouldn’t be brought to them.”</p><p>Harvey said he’s been attacked a number of times by people for doing his job as a journalist and assumed this was another such incident.</p><p>Video footage shows a man in a taupe blazer and tie repeatedly yelling “knock it off” while grabbing Harvey’s left arm and wrist and pressing him back against the wall. The man also shouts “What’s wrong with you?” at Harvey, who can be heard replying, “What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>Harvey attempts to point his camera toward the man, but he shoves it away.

On June 8, the indictment was unsealed.</p><p>According to the unsealed indictment, FBI agents interviewed Wolfe in December 2017 and asked him whether he had been in contact with any reporters, whether he had personal or professional relationships with any reporters, and whether he had given information (classified or unclassified) to reporters that he was not authorized to disclose. According to the indictment, Wolfe falsely told the FBI that he had not.</p><p>The indictment states that he specifically denied knowing Ali Watkins, a national security reporter who currently works at The New York Times and previously worked at BuzzFeed and Politico. When FBI agents later showed Wolfe a photo of him with Watkins, he admitted that he had been in a personal relationship with her for three years, but said that he had not disclosed any confidential information to her.</p><p>According to the Times, the Department of Justice informed Watkins in February that it had seized years’ worth of her phone and email records as part of its investigation into the leaks. Although the Justice Department did not obtain the content of her phone calls, texts, and emails, it did obtain all of the metadata — which reveals who she was in contact with and when she was in contact with them. The Justice Department cited some of those records in the indictment to establish that Wolfe and Watkins spoke to one another shortly before and after she published major stories.</p><p>So far, Wolfe has not been charged with disclosing classified information to Watkins or any other reporters.</p><p>The FBI initially interviewed Wolfe as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information to reporters, but the grand jury only indicted him on charges of lying to FBI agents. It did not indict him on any charges of disclosing classified information. In a press release announcing the indictment, the Department of Justice only alleged that Wolfe had leaked “sensitive and confidential” information, not classified information. Watkins told the Times that Wolfe was not a source of classified information for her.</p><p>Wolfe is the third person since Trump took office to be prosecuted in connection with a leak investigation. In June 2017, NSA contractor Reality Winner was accused of sending news organization The Intercept a classified document about the NSA’s investigation into Russian hacking attempts. In March 2018, former FBI agent Terry Albury was accused of sending The Intercept classified documents that instruct FBI agents on how to cultivate informants and surveil journalists.</p><p>Both Winner and Albury were charged under the Espionage Act — a century-old law originally targeted at foreign spies that has more been used to prosecute people who give classified information to journalists. Albury took a plea deal, while Winner has continued to fight her case, while repeatedly being denied bail.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/james_wolfe.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,"Ali Watkins, The New York Times",

When passing through the screening area, CBP officers asked what he did and why he was traveling to the United States, then directed him to secondary screening.</p><p>Though Preston had previously passed through security, he told CPJ that he was directed through a second metal detector, patted down and taken to a separate room with multiple security cameras and an officer sitting behind a desk. Taking notes on a computer, the CBP officer asked Preston to account for as much of his four years in Lebanon as possible and about all of the countries where he had traveled and reported.</p><p>The officer also asked Preston for proof of his publications and how he “really” earned money: Preston said the officer seemed to not believe that it was economically feasible for him to rely on freelancing alone. The officer kept insisting that point until Preston said he had a roommate with whom he split living expenses, to which the officer responded, “Ah, that makes more sense.”</p><p>Preston pulled up his resume on his laptop to prove that he was a journalist and provide the officer with proof of his publications. While his laptop was open, the officer also asked Preston for information about his social media use, including what his handle and usernames were, and asked him to pull them up.</p><p>Preston told CPJ that the officer did not ask to see his cell phone, and at no point were any of his electronic devices removed from his sight.</p><p>After approximately 20 minutes of questioning, Preston was allowed to leave.

Authorities have not said publicly whether they believe that the murder is connected to Stoner’s work.</p><p>WGN reports that Stoner was last seen alive around 1 a.m. in the early hours of May 30th, when he left a rap concert at Refuge, a club in downtown Chicago. Around 1:30 a.m., he was driving his Jeep down Clark Street in the South Loop neighborhood in Chicago when unknown assailants in a second vehicle pulled alongside him and opened fire. </p><p>The bullets struck Stoner in the head and neck, causing him to drive onto a curb and crash into a light pole. He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in critical condition, but was declared dead at 4:20 a.m., according to a log from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.</p><p>Videos recorded by bystanders immediately after the shooting show three cars — Stoner’s Jeep, a wrecked Chevy Caprice, and a third car — and a group of people running to the third car. One of the persons in the video can be heard shouting, “Let’s go!” </p><p>Stoner, who grew up in a poor suburb of Chicago, ran a Youtube channel called “ZackTV1,” which had over 170,000 followers at the time of his death. On his channel, he posted exclusive interviews with underground hip hop artists and members of local gangs. Though some of his videos were controversial — a few mentioned conspiracy theories and others featured young men throwing gang signs and threatening their rivals  — his friends and associates said that he always tried to remain neutral in gang disputes and was willing to interview anyone.</p><p>“He wasn’t in any gangs and he would and could literally go into any hood with his camera and get nothing but love,” music studio owner JP Lee told the Chicago Sun-Times.</p><p>“I’m hearing stories like they may have been mad at him because he did interviews with certain rappers,&quot; Stoner’s friend Phor Robinson told WGN. &quot;But that’s not his fault for him doing his job. I don’t know why anyone would attack Zack and shoot him. He’s not that type. He shows love to everybody in Chicago.”</p><p>Morgan Elise Johnson, co-founder and creative director of the Chicago-based publication The Triibe, met with Stoner and his business partner Tony Woods a month before Stoner’s death to discuss a potential partnership.</p><p>“His voice was so powerful in the hood, and I don’t know if that power had something to do with his death,” Johnson told the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p><p>Stoner received threats related to his reporting, particularly his coverage of the death of Kenneka Jenkins, a teenage girl. On Sept. 10, 2017, Jenkins was found dead in a walk-in freezer at the Crowne Plaza O’Hare Hotel, where she had attended a party the night before. Although the death was ultimately ruled an accident, it sparked a massive social media frenzy and numerous conspiracy theories.</p><p>Stoner interviewed some of Jenkins’ friends who were with her the night that she died, but initially did not post the videos. In Oct. 2017, he received a threatening phone call from an anonymous woman, who warned him to “leave the case alone… leave it alone for your safety.” At the time, Stoner said that he would not post interviews related to the case because his house had been broken into, his camera gear stolen, and he was receiving threatening phone calls and emails. But in late November, he finally published the videos.</p><p>In April 2018, freelance journalist Charles Preston profiled Stoner for the Chicago Defender.</p><p>“Stoner documents what others neglect and repeatedly interviews personalities who many had hoped would never grace a camera,” Preston wrote. “His videos are not fluffy, glitzy, and sentimental documentary shorts; on the contrary, they are more like visceral punches to the gut that can leave you either inspired for change or disturbed by reality. He has given the city’s most controversial artists their first on-camera interviews and covered neighborhoods where news reporters keep their news trucks running.”</p><p>&quot;I wanted to show the world what the other side of Chicago looks like…our culture — the way we dress, what we eat, how we talk, how we walk,” Stoner told Preston.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people respect what I do,&quot; he added. &quot;I&#x27;m the &#x27;Hood CNN.&#x27;&quot;</p><p>The profile also highlighted Stoner’s involvement in community service work.</p><p>“People don’t see what he does behind the scenes,” Woods, Stoner’s mentor, told the Defender. “There have been many occasions where a guy will call Zack on his way ride on his opps (Chicago slang for enemies) and Zack would talk him down. The brother has a jail phone. He sends money to incarcerated brothers and takes care of their families. People don’t get to see that side of it. They assume because he’s interviewing [members of rival gangs] the GD&#x27;s or BD&#x27;s that he’s fanning the flames and that’s not the case.”</p><p>Shortly after Stoner’s death was confirmed, Preston said on Twitter that Stoner had discussed the possibility of working with the Chicago Defender to create a documentary series about violence in Chicago.</p></div></div>

He landed at the airport at around 8:45 a.m. He said that he presented a CBP agent with his Tunisian passport, bearing a B1 U.S. visa, and was directed to secondary screening. The officer, whom Krichen told CPJ was consistently polite and kind to him, then led him through a police area, fingerprinted him, and accompanied him to the baggage claim area. While waiting for the bags, the officer flipped through his passport —which is three, thoroughly stamped passports glued together — and asked him why he travels so much. He simply responded, “I am a journalist.”</p><p>Once Krichen retrieved his luggage, the officer ushered him into an interview room and began asking him for personal details, including his wife’s name and birthdate, her workplace, her nationality, their full home address, and his contact information. Krichen said that the officer also asked about his work — where he has traveled and why, the names of the programs he hosts, the topics they cover, and who he has interviewed. After these “typical” background questions, Krichen said, the officer’s questions turned to terrorism, “which he seemed obsessed with.”</p><p>The officer asked if he’d had any relationship with an individual involved with terrorism, interviewed someone accused of terrorism, or had any relationship with someone suspected of terrorism. Krichen said that he pulled out his phone and unlocked it to double check the name of a former colleague — Sami al-Hadj — who had been arrested in Afghanistan and detained in Guantanamo Bay for six years. Krichen had interviewed al-Hadj about his time in the prison. </p><p>After asking once again if Krichen had any relationships with individuals suspected of or involved in terrorism, the officer and  Krichen went through his suitcases, piece by piece. After that, Krichen said, the officer asked to see Krichen's unlocked cell phone. The officer asked Krichen if he uses his full name on Facebook and Twitter (he does) and then led him out to a waiting room while the officer walked to a nearby counter to examine the phone. Krichen said that he was able to observe the officer swiping through his phone for five to seven minutes, but he couldn’t see what the officer was browsing through.</p><p>Afterward, the officer made a call — Krichen told CPJ it appeared that he was calling a supervisor — and spoke on the phone for approximately ten minutes, all the while flipping through the notes he had taken during his interview of Krichen. Immediately after hanging up the phone, the officer stamped Krichen’s passport, returned his phone, and told him he was free to leave. Krichen said that the entire incident took about an hour.</p><p>Krichen told CPJ he considered asking why he had been stopped in the first place, as the officer never offered any explanation or apology for stopping him, but he decided against it. He said that he assumes he was selected at random, in part because he doesn’t want “to play the victim or the martyr.”</p><p>“I’m just glad I was only traveling with my phone and not my laptop,” Krichen said, “because they might’ve tried to search that too.”</p><p>According to a CBP directive released in January 2018, travelers are “obligated” to turn over their unlocked and unencrypted devices to CBP agents, who may perform “basic” searches of electronic devices without cause. The CBP directive states that “advanced,” or forensic, searches require “reasonable suspicion of activity in violation of the laws enforced or administered by CBP,” but basic lawful searches using less . The Supreme Court has upheld the so-called “border search exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, though it has not specifically ruled on the consitutionality of searches conducted in accordance with CBP's January 2018 directive.</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,returned in full,False,law enforcement,John F.

We were able to accommodate 10 news outlets and provided a livestream for those we could not accommodate.”</p><p>Meanwhile, EPA communications official Andrea Drinkard told Politico both that the meeting was already at capacity when Knickmeyer tried to enter and also that the meeting’s attendees did not feel comfortable with any press attending the summit.</p><p>It is not clear whether the room was actually at capacity. The Hill&#x27;s Miranda Green, who was invited to cover the summit, reported that a number of the chairs reserved for members of the media remained empty.</p><p>Addressing the treatment of Knickmeyer, Wilcox initially told Axios that he was “unaware of the individual situation that has been reported” and later told NBC News that Knickmeyer had threatened “negative coverage” if she was not let in.</p><p>In a statement released late Tuesday evening, Wilcox claimed that Knickmeyer &quot;pushed through the security entrance.&quot; After the AP objected to that characterization, he released another statement, which said that Knickmeyer &quot;showed up at EPA but refused to leave the building after being asked to do so.&quot;</p><p>According to the AP, an aide to Pruitt eventually called Knickmeyer to personally apologize for the way that she was treated.</p><p>Following public outcry, the EPA reversed its earlier limitations on press access to the summit. Around 12 p.m. on May 22, the agency announced that the second part of the summit — which ran from 1 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and was originally closed to the press and the public — would be open to all journalists.</p></div></div>

On May 22, the AP confirmed that it had received the subpoena and planned to fight it.</p><p>The subpoena is part of a civil suit that Broidy filed in federal court in California against the government of Qatar.

And a lawyer for Broidy told the AP that its reporting ""is based on fraudulent and fabricated documents obtained from entities with a known agenda to harm Mr. Broidy.""</p><p>In the past, both Qatar and the UAE have accused one another of hacking the other, so it's not surprising that Broidy believes that Qatar is connected to the hack and leak of his emails.</p><p>His goal seems to be to use the subpoena to force the AP to turn over documents that implicate Qatar in the leak of his emails, which he can then use as evidence in his civil suit against the Qatari government.</p><p>An AP spokeswoman told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that the news outlet plans to fight the subpoena.

	<div class=""rich-text""><p>For more than a year, Ms. Schmidt, a reporter for the Arizona Daily Star, has been reporting on and covering the relationship between Craig Carter, a former University of Arizona assistant track coach, and a female-student athlete, Baillie Jean Gibson, including allegations that Mr. Carter assaulted Ms. Gibson. Mr. Carter was ultimately criminally convicted of assaulting Ms. Gibson and pled guilty to other felony counts arising out of his conduct in the relationship. Now, in this related civil suit, the Carters, through their attorney, seek to uncover any communications that Ms. Schmidt and any “other person or entity currently or formerly affiliated in any way with the Arizona Daily Star” [see attached subpoena to Arizona Daily Star, Ex. A, ¶ 1] may have had with Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gibson’s lawyers in the course of reporting for the Arizona Daily Star. Specifically, the Subpoenas demand that Ms. Schmidt, the Arizona Daily Star and anyone else “affiliated in any way” with the Star produce all “documents and communications” between: (1) themselves and certain named law firms and attorneys who have purportedly worked for Ms. Gibson; and (2) themselves and Ms. Gibson.</p><p>The Carters, however, are not entitled to these materials. Instead, the Subpoenas must be quashed because the affidavits accompanying them do not satisfy the Media Subpoena Law, A.R.S. § 12-2214, which “protect[s] members of the media from burdensome subpoenas and broad discovery ‘fishing expeditions’ that would,” as here, “interfere with the ongoing business of gathering and reporting news to the public.” <i>Matera v.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>During the presidential campaign, though, the Trump administration routinely denied press credentials to reporters it did not like. But the White House is not supposed to have any role in the process of credentialing media organizations, which has traditionally been the domain of the White House Correspondents Association, an independent group of journalists who cover the White House. Since assuming office, Trump has not moved to revoke any journalist&#x27;s White House press credentials, though his former press secretary once excluded certain news organizations from an informal briefing.</p><p>The president&#x27;s May 9 tweet references a controversial analysis conducted by the Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog, which attempts to gauge the sentiment (positive or negative) of news coverage of Trump on major networks&#x27; evening newscasts. According to the MRC&#x27;s most recent analysis, 90% of the coverage of Trump on ABC, CBS, and NBC evening newscasts between Jan. 1 and April 30, 2018, was negative. That&#x27;s consistent with MRC analyses from 2017, which found that 91% of coverage of Trump on the evening newscasts was negative. </p><p>Although the methodology of the MRC analysis has been criticized, the Fox News morning show “Fox &amp; Friends” cited its results authoritatively on the morning of May 9, shortly before the president’s tweet.</p><p>In his tweet, the president stated that 91% of the news coverage was &quot;negative (Fake).&quot; But the MRC did not try to analyze whether the news coverage was &quot;fake&quot; (i.e. inaccurate), just whether it portrayed Trump in a positive or negative light. The president seems to believe that all negative news coverage of him is &quot;fake,&quot; regardless of whether or not the news coverage is accurate.</p><p>Designating negative coverage as “fake news” and threatening to revoke network’s credentials in order to discourage such reporting has become a marked tendency for this administration.</p><p>Trump frequently criticizes journalists&#x27; reporting on his administration, denouncing it as &quot;fake news&quot; even when it is true. According to the Trump Twitter Archive, he has tweeted the phrase “fake news” at least 40 times this year.</p><p>In a statement, White House Correspondents Association president Margaret Talev denounced Trump’s comments.</p><p>“Some may excuse the president’s inflammatory rhetoric about the media, but just because the president does not like news coverage does not make it fake,” she said. “A free press must be able to report on the good, the bad, the momentous and the mundane, without fear or favor. And a president preventing a free and independent press from covering the workings of our republic would be an unconscionable assault on the First Amendment.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2018-05-11_at_10.53.3.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"Donald Trump, Trump administration, tweet",,,,,,

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>These legal theories, if adopted by the courts, would have broad and dangerous implications for all types of reporters who cover election campaigns.</p><p>After WikiLeaks published documents about the DNC, countless media outlets — including mainstream news publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post — reported on the internal DNC communications and even republished some of the documents. Under the DNC’s theory of the case, the Times and Post could theoretically also be liable for wiretapping, for &quot;knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications” with the DNC.</p><p>(In the 2001 case Bartnicki v. Vopper, the Supreme Court ruled that news organizations have a First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest even if they knew the source of the information violated the law to obtain it.)</p><p>Separate from the case of WikiLeaks, newspapers often report on and publish internal documents and emails from all sorts of electoral campaigns. For example, the Washington Post published internal campaign document from the Trump administration in April 2016. Some of these stories may come from hacked materials, but most come from sources inside a campaign who hand documents over to news organizations without official authorization.</p><p>Under the theory of the DNC’s lawsuit, news organizations that publish internal campaign documents could potentially be sued — or even prosecuted by the government — for economic espionage or theft of trade secrets, raising serious press freedom concerns.</p><p>It&#x27;s not just campaign reporters who are at risk. If the court found WikiLeaks liable for “theft of trade secrets” just for publishing internal information about the DNC, then corporations of all stripes could arguably use the same arguments to silence journalists like John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal reporter who exposed serious misconduct and fraud at the blood-testing company Theranos.</p><p>In a comment on Twitter responding to the lawsuit, WikiLeaks said that its publication of the DNC documents was protected by the First Amendment:</p></div></div>

Another woman in the video, Jennifer Curtiss, a trustee with the Village of Fox River Grove, asks the clerk, “Karen, do you have the authority to be going through this stuff?” prompting Lukasik to respond, “I can do whatever I want.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>The video was filmed on a Nest camera hidden in a bookshelf in the Township Supervisor’s Office and shared via a flash drive mailed anonymously to the Edgar County Watchdogs, a blog that posts responses to Freedom of Information Act requests filed with various government bodies around the state of Illinois.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The attorney for Algonquin Township, James Kelly, claimed the video violated “court orders” and “certain privacy rights” in his letter to YouTube dated March 16, 2018. “The video was unlawfully removed from the Township and turned over to a third party.

The subpoena was quashed on March 20.</p><p>Baars told Freedom of the Press Foundation that a deputy served her the subpoena on March 16, while she was at the Charlottesville General District Court to cover a different trial. The subpoena ordered her to appear in court on March 20, the day of Kessler’s perjury trial.</p><p>Kessler, who co-organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, was charged with one count of perjury for allegedly lying on a criminal complaint that he had filed with the magistrate at the Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail. In the complaint, Kessler said he was assaulted by Jay Taylor. Video evidence later showed that Taylor did not assault Kessler.</p><p>Baars said that James West, her attorney, filed a motion to quash the subpoena just minutes before the clerk’s office closed on March 19. Judge Cheryl Higgins granted the motion following morning on March 20, just before jury selection began for Kessler’s perjury trial.</p><p>Baars isn’t sure why she was subpoenaed, but she said that Kessler’s attorney, Mike Hallahan, told her that he intended to use her testimony to impeach Jay Taylor, the man that Kessler accused of assault. Baars interviewed Taylor for an article about Kessler’s assault claims published on Oct. 10, 2017.</p><p>“During my motions hearing, when Albemarle Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Higgins asked him what questions he intended to ask me, he said it depended on Taylor’s testimony,” she said. </p><p>Hallahan, Kessler’s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Baars said that allowing the subpoena to proceed would have adversely impacted her newsroom. </p><p>“We have a two-man news team here at C-VILLE Weekly, and our other reporter (news editor Lisa Provence) had a different trial to cover that day,” she told Freedom of the Press Foundation. “I was assigned to cover Jason Kessler’s perjury trial, so If I had been sequestered in the witness room, I wouldn’t have been able to do my job.”</p><p>Once the subpoena was quashed, Baars was able cover Kessler’s perjury trial, which lasted less than a day and resulted in the dismissal of the perjury charge against Kessler.</p><p>Baars said that since receiving the subpoena, she has started to question which of her sentences or paragraphs could provoke an attorney to call her to the witness stand. </p><p>“That’s not something I should have to worry about when doing my job,” she said. “If reporters are regularly subpoenaed to testify in court, people could begin to perceive us as an investigative arm of the government. When I’m out reporting, I don’t want to be thinking about what I could be called to testify about in court, and I don’t want that to make potential sources more reluctant to talk to reporters.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Baars_subpoena_top.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,Jason Kessler,,,,,,

The trial was later postponed until July, freeing Daugherty from the initial subpoena to testify. However, it is possible that the prosecutor could attempt to subpoena him again.</p><p>The subpoena ordered Daugherty to appear and testify in Circuit Court for the City of Portsmouth between March 21 and March 23. Daugherty told Freedom of the Press foundation that he thinks he could have been required to be present in court all three days, but more likely, he would have been told to return close to the specific time when he would have been needed. </p><p>On March 20, Daugherty’s attorney Conrad Shumadine filed a motion to quash the subpoena.</p><p>“The trial subpoena issued to Mr. Daugherty raises serious First Amendment issues,” the motion to quash states. “The Virginian-Pilot and Mr. Daugherty respectfully assert that a prosecutor must have some factual basis to subpoena a reporter for testimony and there has to be some reasonable expectancy that the reporter would be called as a witness.” </p><p>Portsmouth Councilman Mark Whitaker was charged with 20 felonies, including identity fraud and forgery, in April 2017. At that time, the Virginian-Pilot reported that Whitaker and his attorneys claimed that the case was biased or politically motivated. </p><p>In October 2017, Scott Daugherty wrote an article for the Virginian-Pilot about the fact that two of Mark Whitaker’s alleged fraud victims claimed he did nothing wrong. For the piece, he interviewed Mark Whitaker.</p><p>“I&#x27;m not really sure what the special prosecutor wanted to ask me, except it probably had to do with that one story,” Daugherty told Freedom of the Press Foundation. “Quite frankly, this isn&#x27;t a case where I&#x27;d really expect the prosecution to want to ask me any questions on the stand. The councilman has never said anything to me indicating he is guilty. To the contrary, he has been pretty adamant from the beginning that this case is politically motivated and that he will be vindicated.”</p><p>Commonwealth Attorney Andrew Robbins declined to discuss what questions he intended to ask Daugherty or confirm that he would refrain from asking about unpublished information.</p><p>In a March 20 affidavit, Daugherty wrote, “If Mark Whitaker had provided me with any information suggesting or tending to the effect that he was guilty of the offenses, I would have included it in the article I wrote about the interview since any such admission would have been highly newsworthy.” </p><p>On March 20, the prosecution and defense agreed to postpone Whitaker’s fraud trial until July so that a discovery order could be entered and a hearing on an unspecified motion scheduled. </p><p>“At the moment, I am not under subpoena,” Daugherty said on March 30. “I believe the special prosecutor will have to subpoena me again if he wants me to testify during [the] new trial.” </p><p>When asked if he intends to subpoena Daugherty again to testify in Whitaker’s trial in July, Commonwealth Attorney Andrew Robbins said it would depend on how the evidence progresses between now and then. </p><p>“Anyone, reporter or anyone else, who takes a statement from a criminal defendant risks being called as a witness,” he told Freedom of the Press Foundation.  </p><p>Although Daugherty has extensively covered the case since Whitaker was first indicted in April 2017, he would not have been able to report on the trial if the subpoena had proceeded.</p><p>&quot;It would have prevented me from covering the trial, both ethically and physically,&quot; he said. &quot;As a witness, I would have probably been barred from the courtroom until it was my time to testify. We probably would have had to have another reporter cover the trial… a reporter who knew the basics of the case, but not all of the details.” </p><p>“Without even getting to the stress a subpoena places on the relationship between a reporter and his sources, getting [subpoenaed] can effectively prevent a reporter from doing his or her job,” he added. “If you can&#x27;t enter a courtroom, you can&#x27;t cover a trial.”</p></div></div>","On June 25, 2018, a judge quashed the subpoena.",None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['DROPPED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Since Watkins was only informed after the fact, she had no way to challenge the seizure.</p><p>Watkins is a national security reporter at the Times, who previously worked at BuzzFeed, Politico, and McClatchy. In February, she received a letter from the Justice Department, informing her that it had obtained her customer records and subscriber information from Verizon and Google. </p><p>Those records, known as “metadata,” include details of each and every call, text message, and email that she sent between 2014 or so, when she was still an undergraduate intern, and December 2017. The metadata does not include the actual content of her calls and emails, but does include the recipient of each call and email, the duration of each call, and the timestamp of each message.</p><p>The Justice Department seized Watkins’ records as part of an investigation into her confidential sources. Between 2014 and late 2017, Watkins was romantically involved with James Wolfe, the director of security for the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Justice Department began an investigation of Wolfe in connection with the leak of classified information to Watkins and other reporters. In December 2017, FBI agents interviewed Wolfe about his contacts with reporters, including Watkins. Federal investigators also approached Watkins around the same time, but she refused to speak with them.</p><p>In February 2018, a grand jury indicted Wolfe on charges of lying to federal investigators, in connection with statements he allegedly made during the December interview. The indictment accuses Wolfe of making false statements about the extent of his contacts with reporters, including Watkins. It also accuses him of making false statements about disclosing sensitive information to Watkins and another reporter.</p><p>Wolfe has not been indicted on charges of leaking classified information — to Watkins or any other reporters — and Watkins told her editors at the Times that he was not a source of classified information for her.</p><p>The seizure of Watkins’ phone and email records is the first (publicly-known) instance of the Justice Department obtaining a journalist’s communications records since Trump took office.</p><p>In 2013, during the Obama administration, it was revealed that the Justice Department secretly obtained access to a Fox News reporter’s private email account, and to months of phone records belonging to the dozens of Associated Press reporters, in an attempt to identify journalists’ sources.</p><p>After public outcry, the current Justice Department implemented voluntary guidelines in 2015. These guidelines direct the Department of Justice to only subpoena journalists for information as a last resort and require the attorney general to personally approve any subpoena of a journalist or news organization.</p><p>The guidelines also instruct the department to provide news organizations of advance notice of subpoenas and records requests related to journalism, so that the news organizations have a chance to fight the subpoenas in court before they are carried out. The guidelines specifically state that the journalist should be given advance notice, “unless the Attorney General determines that, for compelling reasons, such notice would pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.”</p><p>Watkins and The New York Times were not given advance notice or the opportunity to challenge the seizure in court. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Times that the department “fully complied” with its internal guidelines when seizing Watkins’ records.</p><p>The Trump administration has floated the idea of modifying the internal guidelines but so far has not done so. According to the Times, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein told a group of journalists on June 6, 2018 that the guidelines remained in effect.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/ali_watkins.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,Google,tech company,None,None,,,,,,,,

Following the ruling, the coroner’s office released the autopsy reports to dozens of news organizations.

His company, which contracted with government agencies to transport the dead, had been accused of mishandling bodies for over two years. In June, the Office of the State Medical Examiner severed its ties with Fantasia’s company, but it still holds contracts with other agencies.</p><p>“We wanted to photograph him, and see if he was still working in the funeral industry, or going into a funeral home,” Stirling told Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p><p>Stirling and Mills waited in their car outside of Fantasia’s house for several hours before he emerged. Once Fantasia exited the house, Stirling said, he “got into his car and drove at us.”</p><p>Stirling said that Fantasia drove his black Cadillac Escalade down the road, pulled up next to the journalists’ car window, and began yelling obscenities.</p><p>Stirling said that after he identified himself as a reporter and made several attempts to interview Fantasia, Mills made the decision to leave out of concern for their safety. Mills declined to comment.</p><p>“Joe [Fantasia] has a history of violent threats—that’s part of what we documented,” Stirling said.</p><p>Stirling said that Fantasia chased them around the neighborhood and then a second black SUV, driven by Fantasia’s neighbor, joined the chase. Both SUVs followed Stirling and Mills onto nearby Route 46.</p><p>“At this point, we were on the phone with 911,” Stirling said. “Joe’s car pulled up alongside and got in front of us, and the other car got behind us, so we were boxed in.”</p><p>Stirling said that the Fantasia’s neighbor’s SUV then moved to the side of their car and slowed down. Stirling said this gave them no choice but to stop, blocking the flow of traffic across the entire highway.</p><p>A police report of the incident obtained by Freedom of the Press Foundation reads, “At this time the driver of the Escalade later identified as Joseph Fantasia exited his vehicle, began to approach the Nissan Altima and was telling in there direction.”</p><p>“They were moving at us aggressively, but thankfully, we didn&#x27;t have the chance to see what could have happened next — but it wouldn’t have been good,” Stirling said.</p><p>Luckily, Stirling said, one of the cars behind them held two off duty police officers. The officers pulled up alongside the cars, identified themselves, and ordered all three cars to pull over down the road.</p><p>“They put their car in between ours and both of theirs, and they made sure on-duty police officers were on their way,” Stirling said.</p><p>“They stayed until they arrived. I don’t know what would have happened if they weren’t there. They made the best out of what was a bad, scary situation.”</p><p>The altercation was written up as a road rage incident, but neither Fantasia nor his neighbor were arrested or charged for the incident.</p><p>“If there&#x27;s anything that bothers me as a citizen about this, that’s it,” Stirling said. “Two off duty police officers saw what happened. It’s disappointing that not even a reckless driving citation was issued — it’s hard for me to feel like that doesn’t send a bad message.”</p><p>On March 5, Stirling’s article about Fantasia was published.</p></div></div>",,None,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Adrianse,” but the officer did not believe that the press passes were authentic.</p><p>Victor said that CHP officer Adrianse photographed him, as well as his drivers license and license plate, and then threatened to arrest him for being in an exclusionary zone and for possession of (what the officer believed to be) a fraudulent press pass.</p><p>Victor was released without being arrested, but he was unable to complete the interview (since he couldn’t get access to the exclusion zone) and his press pass was never returned to him.</p><p>On Jan. 10, Santa Barbara County declared a “public safety exclusion zone” near Montecito, California, due to dangerous mudslides. Under California law, authorities can prevent members of the public from accessing exclusion zones, but they are supposed to allow any “duly authorized representative of any news service, newspaper, or radio or television station” to enter the area.</p><p>The Santa Barbara California Highway Patrol told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that it has had issues in the past with non-journalists attempting to access exclusion zones.</p><p>“I will let you know we have an issue with people posing as press employees to gain access to the evacuation zone,” Santa Barbara CHP officer Jonathan Gutierrez said. “Every time there is a disaster there is always an issue of looters.”</p><p>Gutierrez said that Adrianse, the officer who stopped Victor, believed that the press pass looked to be homemade and therefore fraudulent.</p><p>“The press passes looked to be fake and could have easily been home made on a basic printer,” he said. “The officer obtained the alleged press pass and called the sergeant on duty, he took a picture and forwarded it to the sergeant who also agreed the passes looked to be fake.”</p><p>Gutierrez also said that officer Adrianse had other reasons to suspect that Victor was not a legitimate journalist covering the mudslides. He said that Adrianse had tried to verify that Victor was a real journalist by using his mobile phone to search online for KZAA’s coverage of the mudslides. When he found KZAA’s Facebook page and saw that it had not posted or shared any stories about the mudslides, he concluded that Victor was not really a journalist on assignment.</p><p>“The officer believed Mr. Lopez was not doing a story about the Montecito mudslide but abusing his position as an employee at a local radio station to travel freely in and out the Montecito Evacuation zone,” Gutierrez said.</p><p>Gutierrez added that Victor and other journalists seeking to access the exclusion zone should apply for official press passes from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department.</p><p>Victor told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that the KZAA press passes were of “poor quality,” but he was still surprised to be stopped because CHP officers had previously accepted the passes.</p><p>“In this zone, there were several roadblocks/checkpoints which we got through, but this officer decided our passes were fraudulent,” he said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/15757801561_6971d6d5ee_k.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,in custody,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

If somebody says something that is totally false, and knowingly false, that the person that has been abused, defamed, libeled, will have meaningful recourse. Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness. So we’re going to take a strong look at that. We want fairness.

We are going to take a very, very strong look at that, and I think what the American people want to see is fairness.”</p><p>There is no federal libel law, but state-level libel laws already give plaintiffs the opportunity for &quot;meaningful recourse&quot; in the courts.

Raguso had used the victim’s statements in her reporting.</p><p>In mid-December 2017, she said, the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office investigator showed up at her apartment and issued her a subpoena to testify in Turner’s criminal trial. Raguso had been covering the case for months but, as a result of the subpoena, was unable to hear and report on the testimony of the main victim in the case.</p><p>“It will impact and limit how I am able to cover the story, which does not serve the community,” she said of the subpoena.</p><p>Raguso wrote in a Dec. 26 declaration that as a journalist, she must remain objective and detached from active participation in stories that she covers. </p><p>“My participation as a witness will also compromise my ability and effectiveness in covering future stories about Defendant Turner — whom I have been covering for some time now — thereby further affecting my ability to do my job in the future.”</p><p>Her attorneys filed a motion to quash the subpoena on Dec. 27, arguing that California’s “press shield law” protected Raguso from being compelled to testify about unpublished information.</p><p>“The subpoena that was issued by the public defender in this case to Emilie was not in any way limited to just published material,” Zachary Colbeth, Raguso’s attorney, told the Freedom of the Press Foundation in an email. “We also believe that had Emilie been compelled to testify, both the public defender and the prosecution would have inevitably wandered, or been tempted to wander, into seeking testimony about unpublished materials.”</p><p>The subpoena was dropped on Jan. 2, 2018. According to Colbeth, the public defender&#x27;s office withdrew the subpoena after questioning the alleged victim in the case, making the motion to quash the subpoena moot.</p><p>“It was disturbing to me how aggressive they were in trying to get me to testify,” Raguso said. “To bring me in as a third party seemed like an inappropriate role for a journalist to have.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Raguso.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,other testimony,['DROPPED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

On Dec. 19, Wiggins lifted the stay.</p><p>The temporary stay issued by Justice David Wiggins blocked the newspaper from publishing information about Des Moines attorney Jaysen McCleary obtained from private medical records.</p><p>“A temporary stay is imposed until the supreme court rules on McCleary&#x27;s combined applications,” Wiggins wrote in the order. “Pending further order from this court, the defendants shall not disclose or share (other than with legal counsel) any information in the defendants&#x27; possession that was obtained exclusively from the reports.”</p><p>The records in question were first made public in July 2017, when they were filed by McCleary’s attorney as part of a personal injury suit that he brought against the city of Des Moines (<i>Jaysen McCleary v. City of Des Moine</i>s). The records probably should have been filed under seal, but they were not, which, which meant that any member of the public could (theoretically) access them.</p><p>McCleary told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that the records containing his private information were mistakenly attached to expert reports that were filed publicly by his attorney. </p><p>In November, Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman obtained a copy of the private records and asked McCleary for comment about them. Soon after, McCleary settled with the city of Des Moines and asked for <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i> to be dismissed.</p><p>On Nov. 16, McCleary filed a motion in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moine</i>s, asking the District Court to seal the expert reports containing his private records. District Court judge Jeffrey Farrell granted the motion and issued a protective order. The protective order prohibits the parties in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i> — i.e., McCleary, the city of Des Moines, and their attorneys — from disseminating the sealed records to the public. The order also requires that any “third parties” in possession of the sealed records destroy them. </p><p>On Nov. 27, McCleary sued Kauffman and the Register in District Court (<i>McCleary v. Kauffman</i>), claiming that Kauffman conspired with the city of Des Moines to defame him and damage his reputation.</p><p>McCleary then filed a motion in <i>McCleary v. Kauffman</i> asking for a temporary injunction. McCleary asked the court to order the Register not to publish any articles including information gleaned from his medical records. He also argued that the paper had violated the protective order issued in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i>, which instructed “third parties” in possession of the records to destroy them.</p><p>On Dec. 7, District Court judge Eliza Ovrom denied the motion for a temporary injunction, ruling that the Register was not subject to the protective order.</p><p>“Mr. McCleary alleges that Clark Kauffman obtained copies of said reports during the period they were part of the public court file,” Ovrom wrote in her order. “Even if true, this court cannot enjoin publication of the reports, as such an injunction would violate the First Amendment and Article I, Section 7. Moreover, the defendants in this case were not parties to [<i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i>], and are not bound by orders in that case.”</p><p>On Dec. 8, McCleary filed an application to show cause in <i>McCleary v. City of Des Moines</i>, essentially asking District Court judge Farrell to hold the Register in contempt of court for violating the protective order.</p><p>Farrell denied the motion on the grounds that the Register was not subject to the protective order.</p><p>“The application must be denied for the same reasons noted by Judge Ovrom,” Farrell wrote. “Neither Mr. Kauffman nor the Register are parties to this case, and thus, neither are subject to the protective order. As a result, the application is denied.”</p><p>McCleary appealed both District Court decisions to the Iowa Supreme Court.</p><p>On Dec. 11, Wiggins ordered that the Register not publish the records until court had ruled on McCleary’s appeal. </p><p>Wiggins may have seen the order as a typical procedural ruling, intended to ensure that the Iowa Supreme Court had a chance to consider the merits of McCleary’s appeal before the Register published the records.</p><p>But whatever his intention, Wiggins’ order had serious First Amendment implications. The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly ruled that the First Amendment prohibits the government from preventing a newspaper from publishing information, barring extraordinary circumstances in which national security is at stake.</p><p>On Dec. 19, after the Register had filed a response to McCleary&#x27;s appeal and McCleary had filed a reply to the response, Wiggins lifted the stay and issued an order denying McCleary&#x27;s appeal. </p><p>Wiggins defended his decision to issue the temporary stay.</p><p>&quot;The stay was strictly temporary in nature, its duration limited to the time necessary for the filing of the defendants’ response, the plaintiff’s reply, and this court’s entry of a ruling on the plaintiff’s combined applications,&quot; he wrote in the order.</p><p>McCleary then asked a three-judge panel to review Wiggins&#x27; decision, but the panel affirmed Wiggins&#x27; ruling and denied McCleary&#x27;s appeal.</p><p>McCleary told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that he now plans to appeal his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>On Dec. 20, the Des Moines Register published an article about McCleary that included information obtained from his medical records.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Polk_County_Courthouse_Des_Moines.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>The Polk County courthouse in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,dropped,,,,,,,,

He said in May 2008 that approximately 50 armed soldiers entered his home without a permit claiming they were searching for “weapons or drugs,” but left after finding no evidence of unlawful activity. At the time, he was writing for the Chihuahua-based El Diario del Noroeste.</p><p>In June 2008, he said, a source informed him that he was on a “hit list” due to his reporting on the military, and he fled Mexico with his then-15-year-old son, Oscar.</p><p>Eduardo Beckett, Gutierrez’s attorney, told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that Gutiérrez was offered physical protection by the Mexican government but declined it because he doubted the government’s ability to effectively protect him.</p><p>In 2008, Gutiérrez claimed political asylum at a border checkpoint in Columbus, New Mexico, and he and his son were taken to separate detention facilities in El Paso, Texas. His son was released to family in the United States in August 2008, and Gutiérrez was released in January 2009.</p><p>While awaiting an asylum decision, Gutierrez and his son settled in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and regularly completed their required check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>On July 19, 2017, nearly a decade after Gutiérrez’s original application for asylum, El Paso immigration judge Robert Hough denied his asylum request, ruling that Gutiérrez’s testimony was not credible, he had not sufficiently established fear of torture, and he had failed to show that the Mexican government could not protect him.</p><p>Beckett, Gutiérrez’s lawyer, believes that the judge underestimated the risks that Mexican journalists face. He said that, although Gutiérrez has not received specific threats from the Mexican military since entering the United States, the reporter still believes he would be killed if he returned to Mexico.</p><p>“The threat is still viable, and military people have long memories,” Beckett said.</p><p>Outside of war zones, Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 42 journalists and media workers were killed there in 2017 alone.</p><p>On Nov. 20, 2017, Gutiérrez’s attorney filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals, asking that the board reopen Gutiérrez&#x27;s asylum case and grant Gutierrez a temporary stay of removal, which would prevent ICE from deporting him while the board considered his appeal.</p><p>On Dec. 7, Gutiérrez and his son attended a routine check-in with ICE, but were unexpectedly detained, according to Beckett. ICE agents served Gutiérrez and his son with deportation papers, and walked them back towards the port of entry. When Beckett acquired an emergency stay of deportation, Gutiérrez and his son were taken to an ICE facility instead of being immediately deported.</p><p>Beckett said that it was technically legal for ICE to deport his client, since an immigration judge had previously denied Gutiérrez&#x27;s asylum request. But he said that the detention and attempted deportation was still very unexpected and unusual, since Gutiérrez had an appeal pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals and there were irregularities in the case.</p><p>On Dec. 22, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed to reconsider Gutiérrez&#x27;s deportation order. Gutierrez and his son remain detained in ICE custody.</p><p>Asked for comment, ICE public affairs officer Leticia Zamarripa would only confirm that, “Emilio and Oscar Gutierrez, citizens of Mexico, remain in ICE custody pending disposition of their immigration cases.”</p><p>Beckett believes that by granting his client asylum, the United States would be promoting democracy.</p><p>“We’re in a time right now where journalists around the world are being threatened,” he said.</p><p>In October 2017, the National Press Club awarded Gutiérrez the Aubuchon Press Freedom Award, which honors journalists who demonstrate the principles of press freedom and transparency in governments through their work.<br/></p></div></div>","Gutiérrez was released from ICE detention on July 26, 2018.

Nasser said that he was wearing his headphones and was holding his recorder with a mic on it as he was returning to the U.S.-side of the border.</p><p>Nasser noticed a sign posted at the U.S. facility which specified that cameras, video cameras and cellphones were not allowed — Nasser said he assumed that audio recording was fine. He told CPJ that he continued recording throughout handing over his passport and having “very normal” exchanges with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer.</p><p>When the officer saw his recorder, Nasser said the officer “freaked out.” Nasser said the officer asked what it was and whether he was currently recording, to which he responded yes. Nasser told CPJ that the officer then effectively shut down to entire line, ordered Nasser to stop recording and called for other officers to assist him.</p><p>The officers directed Nasser to a secondary screening room where they had him wait with another man, and placed his belongings — including his audio recorder, passport and green card — on a desk in his eyesight but out of his reach. While the officers examined his belongings, they did not play any files on the recorder.</p><p>Nasser waited in the screening room for approximately an hour, he said, with officers periodically approaching him and asking the same questions each time: Who was he, what was he doing, what was his reporting on, and why was he recording?</p><p>After the fourth or fifth time he was asked the same series of questions, Nasser said he told the officers that he needed to leave and that he knew the problem was with the minute-long recording of his interaction with the officer. Nasser told CPJ he offered to delete it, and after some awkward fumbling he did so.</p><p>At the end of the encounter, which Nasser said lasted around 2 to 2.5 hours, a final officer — who was wearing a kevlar vest with “DHS” printed on it — approached him and said that he hadn’t technically done anything wrong, but that his actions had been suspicious.</p><p>“We were just doing our jobs,” Nasser recalled the officer saying. While the first few officers were incredibly angry that he had been recording, Nasser said, when the final officer found out it was just audio recording, with no video, “he made it seem like it was no big deal.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,<p></p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,"El Paso, Texas",True,U.S. permanent resident (green card),False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

There Jamieson noticed his boarding pass was flagged with “SSSS.”</p><p>Jamieson told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that his boarding pass had often been flagged with the marker used to signal travelers for secondary screening, which he believed was due to his reporting trips to the Middle East and unusual travel patterns. He added that since registering with CBP’s Global Entry trusted traveler program a few years before, he had not been flagged.</p><p>Jamieson told the Tracker that after he landed at Miami International Airport at around 7:30pm, the automated machines at U.S. Customs flagged his picture with a red ‘X’ and he was directed into the normal processing line, a first for him since applying for Global Entry.</p><p>“When I got to an agent, he immediately sent me off, without explanation, to the secondary questioning area, so I knew I was in for a long wait,” Jamieson said.</p><p>The secondary screening, Jamieson told the Tracker, was “wild.”</p><p>“I had expected a long wait,” he said. “I had not expected to be barked at by CBP agents who were trying to create a kind of ‘boot camp’ atmosphere in which everyone was intimidated and in fear of giving the wrong answer.”</p><p>The CBP officer, whom Jamieson identified as Officer Jones, confiscated his phone and kept it out of his view. Jamieson noted that because he had a screen lock, he does not believe it was accessed or searched. Officer Jones questioned him over the course of an hour, repeatedly using the term “fake news” in reference to his job and asking inappropriate questions about his romantic life.</p><p>“She knew my job without asking, and had clearly Googled my social media profile. She would ask why someone ‘with a good job at an American company’ would visit ‘these kind of countries,’” Jamieson said, referring to Turkey and other Middle Eastern states. “She then went through the list of my Facebook friends to ask which ones were friends or which ones I’d had sex with, or both.”</p></div></div>

Shortly after, she told him to take his passport and “get out.”</p><p>Jamieson was directed to the specialized baggage inspection area where an officer he identified as Officer Yueng mumbled a disparaging remark and questioned whether Jamieson was a cop or insurance salesman. When Jamieson said he was a journalist, the officer responded, “Ugh, worse,” and waved him away without searching his bag.</p><p>Jamieson filed a complaint with CBP on Dec. 6, detailing the encounters and expressing his frustration with a process he said was unnecessary and avoidable.</p><p>“Assertive and robust interrogation is a useful and important tactic for agents in keeping the US border secure. Yelling idiotic and vague questions, hurling insults and generally acting like elementary school bullies is neither effective nor an appropriate use of federal resources,” Jamieson wrote in his complaint.</p><p>CBP responded to Jamieson’s complaint on Dec. 19, writing, “Please allow me to express regret for any conduct that may have been perceived as rude or unprofessional during CBP processing. CBP takes allegations of employee misconduct very seriously and has instituted policies pertaining to abuses of authority.”</p><p>As a matter of policy, CBP does not disclose the outcomes of internal investigations or disciplinary actions taken against personnel.</p><p>In a 2019 interview, Jamieson told the Tracker that while he no longer works for NBC News, this incident has stayed with him.

She was later charged with obstructing a police officer and violating a court order that prohibits the use of recording devices in the courthouse.</p><p>Ex Parte is a court news publication, with online and print editions.</p><p>On Nov. 14, Bassi was inside the Santa Clara County Superior Court’s eighth-floor family records room, assisting family court litigant Scott Largent with research. After Largent took a photograph of some records with his phone, sheriff’s deputies entered the room and confronted Largent, ordering him to delete the photos.</p><p>When the deputies approached Largent, Bassi took out her own phone to record the interaction. She would <a href=""https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Woman-Claims-Santa-Clara-Deputy-Broke-her-Hand-After-Courthouse-Confrontation-458410203.html"">later tell the local NBC news affiliate</a> that she decided to record the deputies’ interaction with Largent because she believed it could be newsworthy. </p><p>After Bassi began recording, one of the deputies approached her and ordered her to stop recording — an interaction that Bassi captured on video.</p><p>In her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0cdz_8JRuI&amp;t=0s&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLMijyO2QQNo47cYyXTyh-zbdaqEgQSGVI"">recording of the incident</a>, a sheriff’s deputy tells her to “stop recording.” Bassi responds, “I heard you,” but continues to record. The deputy then reaches for the phone in Bassi’s hand, and Bassi says, “Give me my phone!” and “You broke my finger!”</p><p>When asked by Bassi, the officer identified himself as Joshua Seymour.</p><p>Bassi and Largent filed a complaint later the same day with the internal affairs division of the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Department alleging excessive use of force.</p><p>On Nov. 15, the day after the incident in the records room, the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s office filed a criminal complaint against Bassi for an earlier, separate incident. The complaint alleges that Bassi took a photograph of a person next to an American flag in the courthouse on Aug. 31, 2017, in violation of the court order that prohibits the use of any recording devices inside the courthouse.<br/></p><p>Bassi <a href=""https://www.sanjoseinside.com/2017/12/06/court-watchdog-arrested-just-weeks-after-violent-encounter-with-sheriff-deputy-over-video/"">later told San Jose Inside</a>, a local politics news site, that she only learned of the charges against her on Dec. 4, when she was stopped and arrested while attempting to enter the courthouse.<br/></p><p>On Jan. 3, 2018, Bassi was arraigned on three counts — two counts of willful disobedience of a court order (for recording inside the courthouse on Aug. 31 and Nov. 14, 2017) and one count of resisting, delaying, or obstructing an officer — and entered a not guilty plea. On March 19, 2018, she was caught recording inside the courthouse once again, which led to a third count of willful disobedience of a court order. <br/></p><p>A jury trial on all four counts is scheduled to begin on March 4.<br/></p><p>On Nov. 29, 2018, Bassi filed a federal lawsuit against Santa Clara County, alleging that her civil rights were violated. That suit has been stayed pending the outcome of Bassi’s criminal trial.<br/></p><p>Rules regarding taking pictures in courtrooms vary significantly from court to court. Bassi’s attorney, Dmitry Stadlin, believes that the local court order is not only vague and overly broad, but also might not be legal.<br/></p><p>“This local rule does not provide definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,” Stadlin wrote in a demurrer. “The local court rule which bans all photography and recordings is a prior restraint on free speech, and thus subjects to close judicial scrutiny and permissible in only the most extraordinary circumstances.”</p><p><i>Editor's note: This article was updated to insert hyperlinks.</i></p><p><i>— The<a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/""> U.S. Press Freedom Tracker</a> catalogues press freedom violations in the United States.

She was ordered to testify at a deposition and turn over materials related to her reporting on the high number of deaths in San Diego County jails. On Feb. 2, 2018, a federal magistrate ruled in favor of Davis, defeating the subpoena.</p><p>Davis has been writing about deaths in San Diego jails for years. In 2013, while working at San Diego City Beat, she and colleague Dave Maass reported that San Diego County had the highest inmate mortality rate out of California’s largest jail systems. Since then, her reporting has been cited in a number of wrongful death lawsuits and complaints filed against San Diego County. </p><p>The widow of Kris Nesmith, an inmate who died while in prison, sued the County of San Diego in 2015. At the time, Davis wrote an article about the lawsuit for the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p><p>In November 2017, attorneys for San Diego County subpoenaed Davis, seeking her testimony as well as her unpublished research related to her reporting.</p><p>The subpoena orders Davis to appear at a deposition on December 11 and to produce “any and all documents, notes, and recordings, including in electronic format, that you relied on when reporting and/or publishing that the San Diego County’s incarceration mortality rate ‘leads in California’s largest jails.’”</p><p>“They wanted everything, written or electronic,” Davis told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “It was a huge fishing investigation to try to get every nook and cranny of information that I had.”</p><p>Maass, who co-wrote the 2013 San Diego City Beat story with Davis, was not subpoenaed in the case. He never wrote specifically about the Kris Nesmith case, and he no longer lives in San Diego or writes about the county’s jails. He criticized San Diego County for attempting to subpoena Davis.</p><p>“This subpoena is of course frightening when it comes to press freedom, but as someone who worked on these stories, it’s concerning that this is how they address safety issues in their jails,” he said. “Rather than address them and stop killing people, the county comes after the messengers who did this research.” </p><p>After Davis’ attorneys objected to the subpoena, San Diego County filed a motion to compel Davis’ testimony. In the motion to compel, attorneys for San Diego County argued that, since Davis&#x27; reporting would be cited during the trial, they should be allowed to question her like an expert witness.</p><p>“They wanted to cut undercut my reporting and to challenge the methodology that my colleague and I initially used,” Davis said. </p><p>On Feb. 2, federal magistrate judge Andrew Schopler ruled in favor of Davis, defeating the subpoena. Davis will not have to testify or hand over her unpublished reporting materials. </p><p>San Diego County did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>",Davis has reported for years on the high number of deaths in San Diego County jails,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/kellydavis.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

Stark said that the officer then told him to stay away from the Gillespie campaign bus, which he refused to do since he was covering Gillespie.</p><p>“I was standing in the street on the far side of the driveway filming the Gillespie RV in anticipation of him disembarking,” Stark said in a statement. “That&#x27;s when I heard the policeman tell me to get out of the road. I complied, and then he told me to leave the Gillespie vehicle and everyone inside it alone. At that point I told the policeman he&#x27;d probably have to arrest me to keep me away from Gillespie. He responded that he would arrest me and approached me aggressively. The ‘conversation’ escalated from there.”</p><p>A video of the arrest shows Stark complying with Rogers’ order to step backward, while continuing to argue with him, as a woman in a red jacket and an additional police officer involve themselves in the exchange. (Stark said that he believes that the woman in the red jacket was associated with the campaign.)</p><p>After Stark says “Fuck this,” the arresting officer — whom Stark later identified as Mason District Police Captain T.J. Rogers — places his hand on Stark’s right shoulder and turns him against a nearby fence. While Stark has both of his hands behind his back, the officer lifts Stark’s right ankle off the ground, sending the reporter face-first into the sidewalk. </p><p>As additional officers rush to the scene, Stark says, “Stop, I will give you my arm. I can’t. You have your weight on top of me. I cannot give you my hand. My hand is beneath me.” Five officers eventually pin Stark to the ground with their knees on the back of his head and his body. They continue demanding his arm as he screams that he cannot comply and begs them to stop.</p><p>Stark told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that officers punched him repeatedly in the legs during the physical takedown and said that his attorney told him that this is a common “softening” technique used against non-cooperative subjects.</p><p>The takedown left Stark with an abrasion to his head and a few bruises. He refused treatment at the time of the arrest. </p><p>“I’ve got a nice bruise on my hip and an ugly scrape on my elbow,” he said. “But as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, I don&#x27;t consider this arrest to have been brutal. Violent? Yes. Brutal? No.”</p><p>Stark also said that his phone was broken during the incident, and he suspects that the officers may have deliberately thrown it against the ground.</p><p>“My brand new phone, a OnePlus 5 that came with Gorilla Glass, was broken during the arrest,” he said. “I don&#x27;t think it was an accident. When I was on the ground, I heard what sounded like a cell phone striking the pavement immediately after it had been retrieved from my hand attached to the arm stuck beneath my body.”</p><p>Stark was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and held in custody for nearly five hours, before being released on a $3,000 bond.</p><p>After Shareblue published video of the arrest on October 31, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler held a press conference, during which he defended the arrest and said that it was appropriate for the officers to use a physical takedown technique on Stark because the reporter was passively resisting arrest. (Stark said that he did not resist the officers, but was only trying to put his phone away when the officers took him down.)</p><p>Roessler told the press that the officer who arrested Stark might have feared for his safety.</p><p>“You must understand that, from the officer’s perspective, he does not know who this gentleman is,” Roessler said. “The gentleman is wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He does not know if this gentleman has a concealed weapon. He does not know what intent this gentleman has, whether it’s to create harm or something else.”</p><p>Stark said that he explicitly identified himself as a journalist to the officers who arrested him.</p><p>Roessler told the press that the officer who arrested Stark may not have believed Stark when he said that he was a journalist.</p><p>“He doesn’t know him personally or who he is, and anybody can say anything,” Roessler said. </p><p>Stark, who has written critically about Gillespie’s campaign, said that the campaign has previously had him removed from events held on private property and has “disinvited” him from the press pool. He believes that the campaign may have asked the police to remove him from the area near the Gillespie campaign bus.</p><p>During the press conference, police chief Roessler said that he did not know whether the Gillespie campaign had any conversations with the police concerning Stark.</p><p>“I have no knowledge of that right now,” Roeller said. “We are investigating this. And if there are any witnesses I would ask that they contact the Fairfax County Police Department. Our Internal Affairs Bureau is actively going out seeking witnesses and networking the community to understand the full picture here, and as I mentioned earlier, our police auditor will also review our completed investigation and report our findings to the community.”</p><p>A police spokesperson referred the Freedom of the Press Foundation to Roessler&#x27;s press conference and declined to comment further.</p></div></div>

He won a George Polk award for his coverage of the McDonald case.</p><p>In February 2015, he published an article in Slate titled “Sixteen Shots,” which reported on evidence, including an autopsy report and statements from witnesses, that contradicted the Chicago police department’s public account of McDonald’s shooting. Kalven also reported on the existence of an unreleased police dash-cam video, which had captured the shooting. After public pressure and a court decision forced the city of Chicago to release the dash-cam video to the public, officer Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder.</p><p>As part of his defense strategy, Van Dyke’s lawyer is trying to force Kalven to testify about his sources.</p><p>Kalven told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that he received a subpoena at his office on Oct. 16, 2017, ordering him to appear in court at 9 a.m. on the following day. Kalven said that he did not attend the Oct. 17 hearing and that his attorney informed Van Dyke’s attorney that he could not attend the hearing on such short notice.</p><p>During the hearing, Van Dyke’s defense attorney argued that Kalven needed to be called in to testify, according to an audio recording of the hearing taped by a journalist in attendance. Van Dyke’s legal team hopes to show that Kalven received leaked documents from the police oversight agency investigating the shooting and that he could have influenced potential witnesses in the case by interviewing them about the murder while reporting the Slate piece.</p><p>Chicago judge Vincent Gaughan seemed receptive to the defense team’s argument, though he did acknowledge that Illinois’ “press shield law” prevents journalists from being compelled to name their sources in some circumstances.</p><p>“The reporter’s privilege concerning the source will have to be litigated,” he said. </p><p>On Nov. 3, Kalven’s attorney filed a motion to quash the subpoena, citing the Illinois Reporter&#x27;s Privilege Act. </p><p>The state law requires a person seeking to compel a reporter to testify about their confidential sources to file a detailed application with the court, which must include &quot;the name of the reporter and of the news medium with which he or she was connected at the time the information sought was obtained; the specific information sought and its relevancy to the proceedings; and [a] specific public interest which would be adversely affected if the factual information sought were not disclosed.&quot;</p><p>The law also sets a high bar for a court to approve such an application; the court must find &quot;that all other available sources of information have been exhausted and [that] disclosure of the information sought is essential to the protection of the public interest involved.&quot;</p><p>Kalven&#x27;s motion to quash the subpoena stated that Van Dyke&#x27;s legal team had not filed an application to overcome his reporter&#x27;s privilege and therefore had not met their burden on the Reporter&#x27;s Privilege Act. Van Dyke&#x27;s attorney later filed an opposition to Kalven&#x27;s motion to quash the subpoena. This opposition was filed under seal, so it is not clear what legal argument it makes.</p><p>On Dec. 5, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (a founding partner of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) led a group of 18 journalism and press freedom publications in filing an amicus brief in support of Kalven’s motion to quash the subpoena. In the amicus brief, RCFP wrote that “the public interest in protecting confidential sources is particularly compelling in this case” and argued that that the Reporter’s Privilege Act should protect Kalven from being forced to testify about his sources.</p><p>On Dec. 6, the court will hear arguments for and against the motion to quash the subpoena.</p><p>Kalven said that even if the motion to quash is denied, he will only answer questions to the extent that his sources are not jeopardized.</p><p>“I can imagine no situation in which I would reveal my source,” he said. </p><p>Kalven is not new to requests to surrender the details of his work. In 2005, the City of Chicago subpoenaed Kalven, seeking his notes, tapes, and other records gathered during reporting on abuse of police power. When he refused to comply, the court moved to hold him in contempt, but the threat dissipated when the case was resolved. </p><p>“I don’t want to say that I’m completely unconcerned about this,” he said. “But I have no internal conflict or anguish about what I should do.”</p></div></div>","On December 13, a judge quashed the subpoena for Kalven to testify.",https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/jamie_kalven_dnainfo.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,testimony about confidential source,['QUASHED'],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"Chicago police department, Laquan McDonald",,,,,,

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Rosenworcel&#x27;s tweet included a link to a document on the FCC’s website titled “The Public and Broadcasting,” which outlines the agency’s regulation of broadcasts.</p><p>“We license only individual broadcast stations,” the document states. “We do not license TV or radio networks (such as CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox) or other organizations with which stations have relationships (such as PBS or NPR), except to the extent that those entities may also be station licensees.”</p><p>While the FCC regulates which local TV stations can broadcast over the air, it does not — and cannot — regulate which networks those stations broadcast. The agency could deny licenses to local stations directly owned by NBC, but doing so would not prevent other stations from broadcasting NBC News. If the FCC did attempt to deny broadcast licenses to NBC-owned stations in retaliation for the network&#x27;s coverage of Trump, it would likely be challenged in court and lose on First Amendment grounds.</p><p>The Radio Television Digital News Association (which is a partner of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) condemned Trump’s tweet.</p><p>“Today’s call by the President of the United States to challenge the licenses of networks is not only dangerous to the American people’s right to access responsible journalism, it represents a clear misunderstanding on his part of how much control the federal government can exercise as it relates to networks and cable channels,” RTDNA executive director Dan Shelley said.</p><p>Trump is not the first president to try to retaliate against journalism organizations by challenging broadcast licenses. </p><p>Newton Minnow, a former FCC director, writes in the Chicago Tribune that John F. Kennedy once called him up to complain that NBC News was broadcasting false information about him.</p><p>&quot;I was at home one evening when Kennedy called, furious because of a television news story,&quot; Minnow recalls. &quot;Executives in the steel industry announced a price increase, which the president believed was a violation of an agreement he had negotiated to avoid a strike. He asked if I had seen NBC&#x27;s newscast in which the steel companies&#x27; execs bitterly attacked the president. I had. The president bellowed: &#x27;Did you see how those guys lied about me? Outrageous! Do something about it!&#x27;&quot;</p><p>Minnow refused to do anything and Kennedy dropped the matter.</p><p>In the 1970s, Richard Nixon and his allies took more serious steps, challenging the broadcast licenses of local TV stations owned by The Washington Post. </p><p>“In 1973, the Associated Press reported on the effort from George Champion Jr., who had been finance chairman for Nixon&#x27;s campaign in Florida, to challenge the license of a Jacksonville, Fla., TV station — WJXT-TV,” Post reporter Aaron Blake writes. “The station was then owned by Newsweek and The Washington Post Co., which also owned The Washington Post. The Post was at that point well into its Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate investigation of the president.”</p><p>Despite Nixon’s efforts, the FCC renewed the broadcast license for WJXT-TV and other stations owned by the Post.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2017-10-11_at_7.47.55.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,NBC,Donald Trump,,,,,,

	<div class=""rich-text""><p>St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Mike Faulk was caught in the kettle Sunday night. A line of bike cops formed across Washington Avenue, east of Tucker Boulevard and police in helmets carrying shields and batons blocked the other three sides of the intersection at Tucker and Washington. Faulk heard the repeated police command, “Move back. Move back.” He had nowhere to go.</p><p>The police lines moved forward, trapping dozens of people — protesters, journalists, area residents and observers alike. Multiple officers knocked Faulk down, he said, and pinned his limbs to the ground. A firm foot pushed his head into the pavement. Once he was subdued, he recalled, an officer squirted pepper spray in his face.</p><p>Police loaded Faulk into a van holding about eight others and took him to the city jail on Tucker, a few blocks to the south. He arrived about midnight and was released about 1:30 p.m. Monday after posting a $50 bond. Faulk was charged with failure to disperse, a municipal charge.</p></div>

	<div class=""rich-text""><p>When he was arrested, Mr. Faulk was standing on a sidewalk reporting on the protests. He was not impeding vehicular or pedestrian traffic. He was clearly identified and credentialed as a reporter for the Post-Dispatch and repeatedly advised several of the arresting officers of his status. Nonetheless, he was rounded up and restrained by police officers who surrounded a large group of people and prevented them from leaving the perimeter in a mechanism we understand is referred to as &quot;kettling.&quot; Independent of whether the &quot;kettle&quot; containment activity was proper under the circumstances (and as the Post-Dispatch has reported, there are serious questions about that), there was no reason why a credentialed reporter should have been arrested or restrained from doing his job of reporting the events. Once the reporter was clearly identified as such, he should have been released immediately and allowed to continue his newsgathering activity.</p><p>Moreover, as we understand the situation, Mr. Faulk was not merely restrained and arrested. While standing on the sidewalk and making no resistance , he was forcefully pushed to the ground by police officers and a police officer&#x27;s boot was placed on his head. As a result of this unneeded and inappropriate force, Mr. Faulk suffered injury to both legs, his back and wrist. Even after being restrained with zip ties and totally subdued, a police officer deliberately sprayed him in the face with pepper spray, mace or some other stinging substance. At some point during the evening, an officer also took it upon himself to review the contents of the cell phone Mr. Faulk was using to communicate and photograph the events of the evening. A bike he was using during his news coverage has not been returned to him. He was held for over thirteen hours in jail, even though one of our editors was at the jail only two hours after the arrest to secure his release. That editor was lied to by jail personnel who told her that he was still in transport, even though he was already at the jail. Jail personnel denied his repeated requests for medical attention. </p></div>

There is simply no justification for his arrest and mistreatment. There has been a noticeable uptick in assaults and arrests of reporters in recent months. This is a dangerous trend that impedes journalists’ right to report and the people’s right to know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Journalism is the only profession protected by name in the Constitution,&quot; St. Louis SPJ chapter president Elizabeth Donald said in a statement. &quot;The First Amendment is not a whimsical academic concept to be dismissed when it becomes inconvenient – or embarrassing to the police.

The lawsuit says that Alston also saw approximately 50 to 100 St. Louis police officers dressed in riot gear, so he and his assistant split up and began filming. According to the complaint, officers did not indicate that the filmmakers should not enter the area or that a mass arrest was imminent.</p><p>Shortly after, a line of police started advancing toward the demonstrators. According to the complaint, an apartment tenant allowed Alston’s assistant to enter the building and escape the marching line of police, but Alston was unable to do the same. Alston then noticed a second line of police approaching from the opposite direction, beginning to box in all those present while pounding their batons against their shields and the ground.</p><p>While continuing to film, Alston and a few other people approached the line of bicycle police who made up one side of the kettle so they could ask to leave.

Alston searched for another exit, but finding none he re-approached a bicycle officer to ask to be let out.</p><p>“Without warning or any verbal directions, the police officer pushed Mr. Alston back with his baton and his shield and started to fire pepper spray directly at Mr. Alston’s face,” the complaint says. “At the same time, a second officer began to pepper spray Mr. Alston.”</p><p>Alston and others around him fell to the ground, and were quickly surrounded by police. According to the complaint, a number of officers began kicking Alston while continuing to douse him in pepper spray for several minutes.</p><p>Officers then turned Alston over and cuffed him with three zip ties, causing immediate pain. Another officer roughly pulled the camera from around Alston’s neck, “slammed” it on the ground and powered it off.</p><p>The lawsuit says that at one point an officer began to taunt Alston.</p><p>“The officer said that this is what Mr. Alston got for wanting to videotape the police.

His camera was returned to him upon his release, but it had been badly damaged and pieces of his lighting equipment — including a lighting fixture and its power source — were lost when he was roughly cuffed.</p><p>According to the complaint, Alston continues to suffer physical and psychological repercussions from his arrest and assault, including persistent numbness in his hand, chronic respiratory issues and nightmares.

He said, in regards to her security experiences every time she travels, that he “would like to come up with a solution that could make everyone happy.”</p><p>Merchant later met with Agent Newcomb and another officer who identified himself as Agent Jerome. The officers asked if she knew anyone who had been “radicalized,” hinting that if she provided them information they could resolve her travel issues. She declined to meet with them again.</p><p>The complaint states that the years of heightened security screenings has had a severe impact on Merchant. “She avoids flying if possible and experiences extreme frustration, anxiety, and humiliation when she does fly,” the complaint says.</p><p>In a 2018 opinion article in The Washington Post, Merchant <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-may-have-to-quit-harvard--because-the-tsa-wont-stop-searching-me/2018/08/14/0dbdbb72-9a55-11e8-b55e-5002300ef004_story.html"">wrote that her experiences</a> being targeted for prolonged secondary screenings exposed the shifting values in America: “Its greatest qualities of freedom, liberty and opportunity have undoubtedly shaped the person I am today. But these values are slowly diminishing, and those liberties are being taken away from us little by little. I fear one day we will be unable to recognize it as the place we called home.”</p></div></div>",,None,None,<p></p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,"Orlando, Florida",True,U.S. citizen,False,True,None,None,None,yes,None,None,None,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,,,,,,,,

He singled me out for some reason. I guess he knew that I had been in St. Louis a long time because he said, ‘You’ve been reporting on this for 30 years. You’ve been reporting black-on-black crime, black people shooting black people, for 30 years, and didn’t do anything.’ So their anger and frustration turned and focused on us at that point. I became surrounded by a group of people. Some of the folks came to protect us as you can see.”</p><p>Gray reported that he was hit by three water bottles, one in the back of the head, and concluded the segment saying, “Again, I understand these people’s frustration. I understand their anger. Perhaps they needed someone to vent it to. Perhaps they needed somebody to go after and criticize. We’re ok. We’re fine. But it just shows how fast things can turn.”</p><p>Gray tweeted a video of the event describing it as the “scariest moment in my career.”</p><p>A video filmed by St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist Denise Hollinshed shows a man following Gray and his camerawoman, Tauna Price, as they attempt to leave the protest.</p></div></div>

He said that a protester knocked his phone into his head while he was conducting an interview. The phone cut his face and forced him to receive treatment at an urgent care clinic.<br/></p><p>“I was holding my phone out in front of me while recording, and my assailant came up to me and knocked my phone directly into my face,” Karacostas said.<br/></p><p>The Student Press Law Center published audio of the incident and immediate aftermath.<br/></p><p>While his attacker re-joined the protest, Karacostas finished his interview and addressed his injury.<br/></p><p>“At first I thought it was just a bruise, but then I noticed blood,” he said.<br/></p><p>London Gibson, a campus reporter for The Daily Texan who also covered the demonstration, told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that she was interviewing another bystander when the altercation occurred.<br/></p><p>“When I turned around, Chase’s face was covered in blood,” she said.<br/></p><p>Karacostas said that he walked with his editor, Ellie Breed, to an urgent care center several blocks away, where he received six stitches near his eyebrow.</p><p>Karacostas identified the assailant as Eric Nava-Perez, a member of Sanctuary UT, one of the groups that organized the protest. Nava-Perez was arrested by the Austin Police Department and charged with assault. According to the Student Press Law Center, Nava-Perez was held for 12 hours at Travis County Jail and has been banned from entering UT Austin’s campus without permission from the dean.</p><p>Nava-Perez did not respond to a request for comment, but Charles Holm, an organizer with Sanctuary UT, criticized Nava-Perez’s arrest. In an interview with the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Holm said that the university’s tactics of policing had contributed to an unsafe atmosphere at the protest and that Nava-Perez felt harassed and defensive due to the presence of police and right-wing bystanders. Jennifer Campbell, another organizer with Sanctuary UT, said that there were multiple police departments present at the protest.<br/></p><p>Holm said there was confusion at the protest as to who was a reporter, since multiple bystanders were documenting the demonstration and because the student journalists did not yet have their press badges for the semester. He said that Nava-Perez may have thought that Karacostas was a right wing heckler.<br/></p><p>Holm said that, while the altercation was an unfortunate event in which a reporter was regrettably injured, he does not believe it was symbolic of an attack on press freedom.<br/></p><p>“There was a general atmosphere of tension that created a chaotic situation,” Holm said.</p><p>Karacostas said that, although he was interviewing a bystander who disagreed with the message of the protest, there was no reason to believe he was with the alt-right. Even if he were sympathetic to the alt-right, he added, “it’s still not okay to knock phones into people’s faces and injure them.”</p><p>Karacostas was surprised by the randomness of the attack, and in contrast to Holm’s account, both he and Gibson described the atmosphere of the protest leading up to the altercation as relatively calm. Karacostas said that he remains committed to his work as a reporter.</p><p>“A lot of blood wasn’t going to stop me from recording,” he said.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/smallereditIMGL0825.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,<p>Chase Karacostas</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"protest, ""student journalism""",,,,,,

Two other activists were standing atop that piece of machinery.</p><p>The protestors Hosea was documenting were trying to halt the replacement of an aging segment of the pipeline constructed in the 1960s. Around 390,000 barrels of oil per day flow through Enbridge&#x27;s Line 3, originating at the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, then stretching across northern Minnesota to the company&#x27;s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin, <a href=""https://www.wpr.org/6-arrested-trespassing-enbridge-pipeline-construction-site"">according</a> to Wisconsin Public Radio.</p><p>Hosea was filming from a public road as well as from the side of the road where the excavator was located. When a Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy asked her to move off the side of the road, she complied. “In under 10 seconds I had obeyed their orders,” Hosea told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>Footage from the protest is included in Hosea&#x27;s 2019 film about clean water, &quot;Thirst for Justice.&quot; The incident in question can be seen at the 2:49 to 3:12 minute mark on the film&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ThirstForJusticeDocumentary/videos/490055155118367/"">trailer</a>. &quot;You&#x27;re under arrest, too,&quot; one of the deputies tells her.</p><p>Deputies arrested Hosea along with the activists, and even though she informed them she was a journalist, she was still searched and detained. &quot;I was just not recognized as a journalist,&quot; Hosea told the Tracker. &quot;There were five activists and there was me, we were all being lumped together.&quot;</p><p>Hosea was charged with one count of disorderly conduct and trespass to land. Two activists faced the same charges, and three others were charged with resisting an officer, disorderly conduct and trespass to land.

The disorderly conduct charge was dismissed. First Amendment lawyer Henry Kaufman represented her on a pro bono basis.</p><p>In order to start a journalism fellowship at the University of Michigan&#x27;s School of Environment and Sustainability, Hosea, a British citizen, had to leave the country to renew her U.S. visa while the charges were still pending. Due to the charges, she was called into a special interview at the U.S. Embassy. &quot;I was very lucky I got my visa,&quot; she told the Tracker.</p><p>Hosea said that the arrest was a “complete overreaction” and the legal process left her feeling intimidated. &quot;As a foreign journalist it made me very nervous,” Hosea said. &quot;I am going to be much more cautious working in America.

He said that there were three or four confrontations in which he was ordered to stop filming and that protesters would block the cameras with shields and would sometimes escort reporters away from the scene.</p><p>Armando Aparicio, Woodhouse’s partner on the documentary project, told Ellerbeck that one protester put a shield in his face and followed him everyone that he went. He said that protesters were screaming that they did not want to be in his video. Aparicio said that he put a cap on his lens and stepped back after being threatened.</p><p>Both Woodhouse and Aparicio said that the protesters seemed to have a conflicted relationship with the media. The protest took place in a public sphere and banners and signs seemed designed to be captured by the press, but at the same time protesters seemed to be afraid of having their identities captured on camera. </p><p>“There is a fear of doxing [having identities publicly revealed] both by the alt right and law enforcement,” said Aparicio.</p><p>“We were in a public park,” Woodhouse wrote on his blog. “It was a big news event, where everybody knew there would be media. Activists in the Black Bloc were concealed by sunglasses and ski masks to protect their identity for exactly this reason. They carried flags and banners, to make themselves a spectacle. Yet for their personal security, many of them decided that it was their right to command photographers not to take their pictures, to physically block them from doing so, and if they persisted, to smash their equipment and assault them.”</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2017-09-12_at_1.11.31.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A screengrab from a video shot by Nathan Hope shows a protester trying to block him from filming an assault.</p>,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,"anti-fascist protest, protest",,,,,,

His shirt was ripped in half and he was missing one of his two iPhones, his camera’s 70-200mm zoom lens and his reporter’s notebook.<br/></p><p>Minsky said that he was examined by EMTs and put in ambulance, but that he refused to go to the hospital because he did not have health insurance.</p><p>“I refused medical attention,” he said. “I don’t have medical insurance. … After the police brought me to the sidewalk and the EMTs looked at me, I was put in the back of the ambulance. I continually told them, you know, ‘I don’t want medical attention, please leave me here, it’s fine.’”</p><p>After being let out of the ambulance, Minsky said, he bought a new shirt at Walgreens and then returned to the park to continue covering the protest, only to find that it had already ended.</p><p>Minsky later noticed a sharp pain in his chest and had difficulty breathing — a possible sign of a bruised or broken rib. </p><p>“I didn’t realize I was hit on the ribs until after I started driving home,” he said. “It became very apparent that it was hard to breathe and there was a sharp pain in my right rib cage and at one particular spot. I was touching it, and it felt really tender and hurt really bad. You know, it was difficult to breathe and it still kind of hurts.”</p><p>Minsky said that the pain in his ribs lasted about a week and that he still finds it difficult to breathe, especially when he is lying down or trying to sleep. He said that his wife, a physician’s assistant, believes that his rib is broken, but that he does not know for sure because he has not had a chest X-ray.</p></div></div>

The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/opinion/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html?module=inline"">editorial</a> connected Palin’s rhetoric with the 2011 mass shooting of Rep.

They direct the Department of Justice to only subpoena journalists for information as a last resort and require the attorney general to personally approve any subpoena of a journalist or news organization.</p><p>The guidelines also instruct the department to provide news organizations of advance notice of subpoenas and records requests related to journalism, so that the news organizations have a chance to fight the subpoenas in court before they are carried out.</p><p>The &quot;advance notice&quot; policy is a relatively recent addition to the guidelines. It was partly a response to concern that the Justice Department had secretly obtained journalists&#x27; communications as part of its leak investigations.</p><p>In 2013, it was revealed that the Justice Department secretly obtained access to a Fox News reporter&#x27;s private email account, and to months of phone records belonging to the Associated Press newsroom, in an attempt to identify journalists&#x27; sources.</p><p>If the Department of Justice makes it easier to subpoena journalists, then more journalists are likely to be threatened with jail time.

During this first crossing, Moore recalled, the officer had asked her an “unusual” number of questions. She said that typically the officers will ask five or six questions, but this time the officer asked twice as many. Moore said that the CBP officers asked her why she was entering Canada, and after she said that she was a journalist about to write about an event, one of the officers “said something like, ‘We’re going to keep an eye on you,’ or something ominous like that.”</p><p>She didn’t give the comment a second thought — until that evening, when she tried to cross the border back into the United States around 11:30 p.m. Immediately after she pulled up to the U.S. border stop, she said, CBP officers told her to park her car and leave her phone on the dashboard, powered on and unlocked. The officers also asked her if she had a passcode on her phone, which she did not.</p><p>The officers directed Moore into an office to wait, and while she wasn’t questioned, the officer working at the desk would not tell her how long the search would take and that she’d simply need to wait. After about 15 minutes, she was allowed to return to her car, which had clearly been searched. Moore told CPJ that the officers left some of her belongings strewn on the ground and the doors and trunk partially open.</p><p>Moore also noticed that her phone had been moved, and she is believes it is possible, if not likely, that the CBP officers may have accessed some of her confidential information and sources, including information related to a piece she is currently working on that involves illegal border crossing.</p><p>Journalists have little legal protection when it comes to electronic device searches at the border. A 2018 CBP directive requires agents to consult legal counsel if an individual objects to a search on the grounds of attorney–client privilege, but does not provide the same protection for journalists protecting confidential sources or materials.

At the time, Samsundar was reporting for Alpha News, an online news organization that covers Minnesota politics. </p><p>“I cover the news,” she tells the protesters.</p><p>One of the protesters repeatedly tells her to leave. She continues filming — ""It's a free country,"" she says — and then a man in black baseball cap briefly appears on screen before the picture quickly shudders and momentarily cuts out.  </p><p>Samsundar described what happened in an article on Alpha News, published June 11, 2017.</p><p>“He then grabbed my work phone, which was mounted on a portable selfie-stick, shoved me out of the way and threw the phone several feet away, in front of a line of State Patrol Officers,"" she wrote. ""The screen was completely shattered, but still recording.”</p><p>Samsundar believes that protesters also stole her personal phone, in addition to grabbing and throwing her work phone. </p><p>“I had my second phone in my backpack where I kept all of my equipment,"" she said. ""After I moved away from the group to be a bit safer, I went to look for my personal cell phone to see if I could use it to call my boss. ... That's when I knew it was gone.”<br/></p><p>After the protest, Samsundar said, some of the anti-fascist protesters followed her to her car after the protest.<br/></p><p>“I got into my car and that’s when they surrounded me and my car, started pounding on the windows,"" she said, adding the protesters threatened to break her windows if she didn't leave.</p><p>Mitch Berg, a local conservative radio show host, had planned to interview Samsundar after the rally. He said that Samsundar called him and told him that she had been surrounded by protesters angry with her reporting.</p><p>“I sent her a Facebook message asking if she could come on the air with me when she got clear of whatever was going on,"" Berg told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. ""She said she’d try and then she called me when she was going towards her car, and she mentioned she was being followed to her car. I could hear in the background, some yelling and some commotion. ... She mentioned, as I recall, her car was surrounded and people were a little too close for comfort, a little too animated for civil society, and she hung up and called me back about ten or fifteen minutes later.”</p><p>After the protest, Samsundar filed a police report with the St. Paul police department.</p><p>A spokesman for the St. Paul Police Department confirmed the contents of Samsundar’s police report, and told the Freedom of the Press Foundation the case is currently listed as inactive. </p><p>“Based on the reports, it looks like the journalist's personal cell phone was stolen and her work phone (and a selfie stick) were grabbed by a suspect and thrown about 25 to 30 feet, causing its face to crack. A group also followed her to her car, pounded on the vehicle and threatened her as she drove away.</p><p>An investigator worked to identify the suspect but was unfortunately able to do so.”</p><p>When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Minnesota State Patrol said simply, “The items reported stolen occurred on a city street, which is St. Paul Police's jurisdiction.”</p><p>After learning about what happened to Samsundar on June 10, Alpha News hired private security for her.</p><p>Samsundar said that a bodyguard accompanied her the next time she reported on a protest, but she was still harassed.</p><p>""I was being threatened and people came up to me and said I need to behave myself or else,"" she said. ""The bodyguard with me was like, 'I don’t want you to get hurt. I want you to be safe, so if you please could just do as little as possible in this situation to make it work that’d be great.' I was a little bummed because as a journalist I want to talk to these people, find out why they’re here, and I’m being told I can’t.”</p><p>Samsundar said that she continued filming the protest march for ten to fifteen minutes, until the harassment escalated and her security guard pulled her back and advised her to leave the protest.</p><p>After that experience, Samsundar left journalism. She is now a communications specialist for the Minnesota GOP.</p><p>“These guys targeted me from day one once they knew who I was,"" she said. ""It got to the point where my bosses didn't want me going out to cover stories because they feared for my safety. It was one reason I changed jobs. If I couldn't go out and do my job, there was no point.”</p><p>Organizers of the June 10 counter-protest did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p></p><p></p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/preya.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,,None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,private individual,yes,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,,"anti-fascist protest, protest",,,,,,

Michael Holdman against the city of Des Plaines, Des Plaines Police Chief William Kushner, and police Sgt. John Rice.</p><p>In 2015, Wessell wrote an article about Des Plaines police officers viewing a pornographic image on a department computer inside the Des Plaines Police Station. The article relied on an anonymous source who gave the paper a copy of a photograph that showed officers looking at the image.</p><p>Holdman was accused of leaking the photograph to the paper and demoted. In 2017, he filed a lawsuit against the City of Des Plaines, the police chief, and a fellow officer. </p><p>In May 2017, the defendants in that lawsuit subpoenaed Wessell, seeking to uncover the identity of his source for the 2015 story.</p><p>Wessell told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that he believes the defendants subpoenaed him in an attempt to confirm that Sgt. Holdman was the leaker, which would potentially exonerate them of wrongdoing.</p><p>In accordance with a court order, Wessell ultimately agreed to answer a single yes/no question.</p><p>“I was not going to reveal any source whatsoever, I was steadfast in that,” he said. “In the settlement, I agreed to them asking me one question. The one question was, ‘Did I get the information, the picture, from Holdman?’ and the answer was ‘no,’ and that was it. It was over. So they have no idea where I got it and they never will.”</p><p>Although Wessell was not forced to reveal his source, the case presented a financial burden for him.</p><p>“It was a very strange case to begin with and I knew we were in the right,” he said. “My lawyer had to make motions and go to court and it cost a lot of money, you know.”</p><p>The Des Plaines police department did not immediately return a request for comment.

According to <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/alasaad-v-duke-aclu-amended-complaint"">the legal complaint</a>, filed in Sept. 2017, Merchant was returning to the U.S. after visiting her uncle in Toronto. When CBP officers directed her to secondary inspection, they took her laptop and and ordered her to turn over her smartphone.</p><p>Merchant objected, in part because her phone contained pictures of her without her headscarf that she did not want the male officers to see, but also because it contained information and communications related to her blog. According to the complaint, a CBP officer told her that her phone would be seized indefinitely if she did not comply.</p><p>“In tears, Ms. Merchant unlocked her phone. She also provided the password to unlock her laptop,” the complaint added.</p><p>During the hour and a half that Merchant’s electronic devices were out of her sight, CBP officers thoroughly searcher her bags, read her graduate school notebooks and questioned her about her religious affiliation and her blog. Officers specifically asked about an article she had written for Zainab Rights describing her experience at the border in 2016 which was critical of CBP’s actions.</p><p>Merchant spent approximately two hours in the inspection area before she was permitted to leave for the boarding area. When her devices were returned, her Facebook app was open to her friends list, which was not the case when she turned over her phone.</p><p>According to a <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/zainab-merchant-administrative-complaint-department-homeland-security"">separate complaint</a> the organizations filed with DHS on Merchant’s behalf in 2018, when she arrived at the boarding gate, she underwent another pat-down.</p><p>The complaint states that Merchant was also subjected to additional screening when she landed in Newark, New Jersey for her connecting flight. The Transportation Security Administration officer checking Merchant’s boarding pass told her she would need to pass through security again, a process which took an hour and caused her to miss her flight.</p><p>In a 2018 opinion article in The Washington Post, Merchant <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-may-have-to-quit-harvard--because-the-tsa-wont-stop-searching-me/2018/08/14/0dbdbb72-9a55-11e8-b55e-5002300ef004_story.html"">outlined how she was detained</a> for secondary screenings <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-graduate-student-stopped-again-secondary-screening/"">multiple times</a> in the previous two year period, including one in 2016 that involved her husband and then-6-month-old baby for six hours. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker includes incidents only from 2017 forward.</p><p>In the Post, Merchant said that as the stops continued she filed a complaint through DHS’s Travel Redress Inquiry Program, wrote to members of Congress and applied for TSA Precheck and CBP Global Entry, programs designed to expedite domestic and international travel. She said her efforts were to no avail.</p><p>“Am I being stopped because I am Muslim, or because my family once traveled to Iran to visit a holy shrine?

As a member of the Marine Corps&#x27; inactive reserves, LaPorta had free access to the base with his military ID.</p><p>LaPorta is a frequent contributor to The Daily Beast and has reported extensively on the Marine Corps, including sensitive subjects like revenge porn and sexual harassment among Marines.</p><p>On Feb. 5, 2017, LaPorta said, he visited Camp Lejeune to meet with a source who lives on the base. LaPorta said that his source — a woman who accused a high-ranking officer of sexually assaulting her — invited him into her home on the base so that he could interview her. LaPorta said that he did not notify Camp Lejeune&#x27;s public affairs office before his visit, in part because his source specifically told him that she did not trust the public affairs office.</p><p>After interviewing the woman, LaPorta said, he went to Camp Lejeune&#x27;s brig to visit the officer accused of sexual assault. Camp Lejeune&#x27;s public affairs office prohibits journalists from interviewing detainees in the brig without permission, but LaPorta said that he only went to briefly visit the officer, not to formally interview him. (LaPorta said that he had already interviewed the officer twice before he was taken into custody and so had no reason to interview him again during the February visit.)</p><p>Five days later, Camp Lejeune deputy commander Col. Scalise sent a letter to LaPorta informing him that he had violated regulations by interviewing the woman and visiting the officer in the brig. The letter warned that he would be indefinitely &quot;debarred&quot; from entering the base:</p></div></div>

Additionally, you violated [another regulation]; which states &quot;Personal interviews and telephonic communications between prisoners and media representatives is not authorized, unless a determination is made that such an interview serves the legitimate public interest, or is in the best interest of the military.</i></p><p><i>Based upon the serious nature of your misconduct, you are being debarred from MCB CAMLEJ.

One of the rubber bullets shattered the bone in his little finger, which required him to go to the hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota, for immediate reconstructive surgery. He underwent a second surgery and months of physical therapy. In all, Ziegler had to pay more than $30,000 in medical costs as a result of the injury from the rubber bullet.</p><p>Ziegler said that he believes that the police deliberately targeted him and aimed for his camera.</p><p>He also said that the police response was unprovoked.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>In video of the altercation recorded by Tisdale, she can be heard repeatedly asking Wooten, “What is your name? What is your name, sir?”</p><p>Wooten refuses to give her his name and says, “I’ve been real nice, but now you’re going to jail for resisting arrest.”</p><p>“You’ll see [my name] on the warrant when we get to the jail,” he tells her at another point in the video.</p><p>Tisdale protests that she has the right to film the public rally — “this was a public event posted on Facebook by [Georgia] governor [Nathan] Deal,” she says — and claims that she received permission to film from Kathy Burt, who owns Burt’s Farm along with her husband.</p><p>“I spoke with several candidates, and they didn’t mind,” she says. “Kathy Burt said it was OK. I spoke with her when I first arrived!”</p><p>In the video, Johnny Burt says that she does not permission to film the rally: “Listen, I’m the owner and I say no.”<br/>Burt’s Farm did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The video ends shortly after Wooten forcibly pushes away Tisdale’s camera, at which point Tisdale can be heard screaming off-screen, “Ow, that hurts! You’re hurting me! You are really hurting me!”</p><p>Tisdale told the Freedom of the Press Foundation that after the video was shut off, two uniformed Dawson County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrived to take her into custody. At this point, she said, Wooten finally revealed his name and formally placed her under arrest, but did not give a reason for the arrest or read Tisdale her Miranda rights.</p><p>Tisdale was eventually charged with felony obstruction, felony trespassing, and misdemeanor obstruction of an officer. At trial, prosecutors accused her of elbowing and kicking Wooten.</p><p>The Dawson County Sheriff’s Office seized Tisdale’s camera when she was arrested and held it in custody for six days before returning it to her.</p><p>Tisdale believes that the police may have edited her video footage of the altercation.</p><p>She said that she checked the video footage on her camera once it was returned to her and noticed that her video footage had been split into two separate videos, and the portion of the video in which she could be heard screaming had been inexplicably deleted.</p><p>An audio recording of the incident, captured by Brian Pritchard of FetchYourNews, clearly shows that Tisdale screamed for help during the altercation.</p><p>Dawson County Sheriff Billy Carlisle told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the department had not edited Tisdale’s video footage.</p><p>Tisdale said that she had bruises on her arms, feet, and pelvic region for days after the altercation and had trouble eating and sleeping.</p><p>In August 2016, Tisdale filed a sexual assault complaint against Captain Tony Wooten, alleging that he pushed his crotch into her buttocks while he bent her over a countertop. That case was stayed pending the outcome of the criminal charges against Tisdale.</p><p>On Aug. 8, 2016, Tony Wooten resigned from the Dawson County Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>On Dec. 4, 2017, a Dawsonville jury convicted Tisdale on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of an officer, but acquitted her of felony charges of obstruction and trespassing.</p><p>“This is a partial victory, but not a complete victory, and I maintain my innocence of all charges,” Tisdale told the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “Video recording is not a crime.”</p><p>On Dec. 18, 2017, Tisdale was sentenced to 12 months probation, 40 hours of community service, and a $1000 fine.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Screen_Shot_2018-01-11_at_7.31.03.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,<p>A screengrab from Nydia Tisdale&#x27;s video shows Dawsonville County Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputy Tony Wooten pushing her into a countertop before taking her into custody.</p>,arrested and released,convicted,None,None,True,None,returned in part,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,law enforcement,yes,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,,,obstructing a public officer,"felony, obstructing a public officer, trespassing",,,,
